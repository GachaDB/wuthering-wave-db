Her hair is styled in a low ponytail, tied with a circular ornament. though the sides of her hair from the back are loose, instead of going down with the tied bit of hair. Her hair is also tied with a gray tie, close to her head. She has two strands in front, with her right side bang having a white streak, same for her right strand. Her Tacet mark is on her right thigh."

This exposure caused the activation of the corresponding Remnant frequencies within her. According to Baizhi's recounts, she experienced a strong urge to revive a teammate during her Awakening. As a result, the aforementioned frequencies manifested as a Remnant Creature that now serves as her companion.\n\nResonator Baizhi's Tacet Mark is located on the anterior side of her right thigh. No significant physical alterations after Awakening have been observed.\n\nHowever, when exerting her Forte, the Tacet Mark emits a faint white glow with the advent of the above Remnant Creature. The creature is translucent white in color and resembles the petals of Epiphyllum. It is unable to vocalize in human language, but can communicate with Baizhi through telepathy.\n\nResonator Baizhi cannot directly utilize her Forte, but she can leverage the extremely low temperature and her Remnant Creature's healing abilities to treat injuries in her vicinity.\n\nResonator Baizhi's Resonance Spectrum Pattern does not resemble any known frequencies. However, it shows a certain level of similarity with the fluctuations of Remnant Energy, and it possesses a strong Syntony Response with \"You'tan\", her Remnant Creature. Despite these connections, the cause of Baizhi's Awakening remains unclear without adequate theoretical evidence.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a gradual increase followed by steep rise in its middle section. Resonator Baizhi is thus classified as a Mutant Resonator with a Dormant Period.",

She adjusts her plan as needed, moving forward with precision and purpose.",

She concluded that no matter how complex it may appear, the sphere would always roll uncontrollably to its destined end according to the device’s design.

While her passion for knowledge was admirable, Baizhi’s obsession with theoretical concepts had distanced her from reality. She spent hours poring over esoteric texts and conducting simulations instead of enjoying life or making friends.",
          "Some days later, Baizhi received an invitation to the Huaxu Academy’s scientific expedition base. That afternoon, she saw a device larger and more intricate than any before — components symbolizing different variables, intricately connected like a complex organic system. Yet, despite its grandeur, the device was still incomplete and too uncertain to become her “sphere” in what she was planning to achieve. With pensive eyes, Baizhi examined each part and formed hypotheses on how it functioned.",

It was more accurately painted by endless blankets of white snow, the shivers that still crept through insulated gear, and the desperate knocking of frozen instruments. This theory was merely a skeleton, in need of real feelings and experiences for true understanding. Baizhi dutifully accompanied her team to other sites, not just ordinary ruins but surreal places filled with Remnant energy — pure and complete information that remained elusive and intangible.

          "They veered off the main roads and soon found themselves in a desolate place, shrouded in dense fog and overgrown with vegetation. Eerie cries echoed from the depths of the forest — was it a child's wail or a cat's scream? No one knew the answer.",
          "The bandit, stealing a glance at the girl, worried that his prey may be scared off by the bloodcurdling ambiance.",
          "However, she still wore a calm expression with no trace of fear on her beautiful face.",
          "\"Stupid chick,\" the bandit snickered to himself.",

          "\"Exactly!\" replied the girl with a bright smile.",
          "Amidst deafening screams and agonized moans, crimson blood splattered everywhere... And so began a brutal slaughter that hushed even the evening glow."

          "“What happened to it?” Uncle Wei furrowed his brow and inquired. He was no stranger to repairing all kinds of damaged weapons; still, he couldn’t help but wonder what could have caused such significant wear on this blade.",
          "In his mind’s eye, Uncle Wei conjured up an image of a formidable big man wielding the sword with immense power, slashing through whatever stood in his way without mercy. By no means could he relate this image to a slender girl like her.",
          "“Sorry, I may have hit them a bit too hard... I didn’t mean it...” the girl answered, her embarrassment evident. “Is it difficult to repair?”",
          "Uncle Wei stared at her in disbelief. He examined the rolled edge with his callused finger and replied, “...No worries. I’ll give it a go.”",
          "With precision and skill, Uncle Wei heated the blade until it glowed and struck it forcefully with his hammer. Sparks flew, but the blade remained unyielding. Years of expertise guided him as he inspected and stroked the damaged metal, contemplating each blow. In a moment of clarity, he discovered the problem.",
          "“The blade is exceptionally hard but lacks toughness. Its center of mass is off now, and it has a special frequency. It’s difficult to repair and sharpen with traditional tools.”",
          "“If you wanna get it repaired,” Uncle Wei continued, “you’ll need some really hard gray chalks with a good amount of Tacetite. But they’re not easy to get, only found in a dangerous place, with a lot of rock cliffs! Don’t get your hopes up, kid.”",
          "“You mean the Desorock Highland, right? Please give me some time. I’ll be back soon.”",

She always puts one in her pocket first, and then eagerly breaks apart the other, savoring each piece like it's a precious gem.",
          "A food vendor lady noticed Danjin always came alone and couldn't help but feel sorry for her: Even the cheapest snacks in Jinzhou, like Loong Whispers Crisps, seemed so precious to this girl. Wanting to spread some kindness, the lady started giving Danjin extra snacks popular with girls her age — from pretty Rock Sugar to fluffy Dreamy Floss, and more. At first, Danjin would always refuse, because she felt uncomfortable accepting someone's generosity without a good reason, and because her wallet was running on empty from constantly repairing her weapons.",
          "However, the lady insisted it wouldn't be trouble to let Danjin have some more sweets for free, as she always prepared extra snacks for her sweets-loving younger sister back home, who was approximately Danjin's age. Touched by this genuine kindness, Danjin eventually nodded and accepted the extra snacks.",
          "From that day on, every time the vendor lady gave Danjin extra snacks, a mysterious gift appeared on her stall. Rock sugar brought a Pearl Leaf, while Dreamy Floss resulted in a Caltrop. These herbs were crucial in easing her younger sister's panic disorder, which she hadn't even told Danjin about.",

It seemed like an impenetrable barrier, preventing anyone from escaping their grasp. Day after day, month after month, new tragedies emerged as other evildoers continued their reign of terror.

She would not rest until justice was served and peace was restored.",

I’ve got to take care of the other little ones from that orphanage, too.” He pleaded, knowing that being teased by a child was insignificant compared to fulfilling his duties for the Black Shores.",
          "“Anyway, back to the point. Little one, are you coming with me?” Aalto’s tone shifted from lighthearted to serious, but soon reverted to his usual playfulness, “You can have as many candies as you want. Well... not too many, though. It’s bad for your teeth.”",
          "“That sounds suspicious,” Encore replied, her bright eyes blinking with curiosity. Rather than answering Aalto’s question, she picked up Cosmos and Cloudy, bringing them close to her ears. “Woolies? You got something to tell me? Hmm... Wow, really? So this weird uncle is actually a good guy? No way!”",
          "“Hey, I’ll forgive you for calling me an uncle now, but what’s with the ‘No way’? Do I not look like the perfect stand up guy?”",

          "“Sure,” Aalto agreed without hesitation. Those are just some ordinary plushies, aren’t they? Aalto studied the plushies before him, trying to understand a child’s perspective. It felt strange to him, but Encore seemed to truly believe in their existence.",
          "It was an adventure, a new adventure! Encore embraced her Woolie companions with joy, spinning first with Cosmos and then with Cloudy. As she had grown older, she learned to treat all her friends with equal love and care.",
          "Suddenly, a crucial question struck Encore. “What are we going to do?”",
          "“Well...” Aalto donned his sunglasses once again, replying, “To save the world, of course!”"

Quickly summoning the other commanders in the military, Jiyan devised a plan and led their coordinated army to face the enemy head on. With precision, they used Sound Emulators set in a narrow valley to emit the shadow raven's frequency. As he expected, the Tacet Discords were drawn towards the sound, allowing for their easy capture.",

When Mortefi's Forte is activated, crystalline matter in the shape of dragon scales materializes around his Tacet Mark. These scales burn intensely as he harnesses his power.\n\nResonator Mortefi demonstrates the ability to generate and manipulate fire through the focused concentration of heat. The intensity of the flames produced is closely linked to Mortefi's emotional state. Extensive experimentation has revealed that the fire is a tangible manifestation of Mortefi's accumulated negative emotions over a certain threshold.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Mortefi has been observed to align closely with that of the Dragonkin, a species that is currently declared extinct. Due to the unavailability of living Dragonkin for Syntony tests, it is currently not possible to empirically confirm the cause of Mortefi's Awakening.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve, with a steep rise in its middle section. Resonator Mortefi is thereby classified as a Mutant Resonator.",

Maximum recorded Overclock rating: Moderate.\n\nDuring Overclocking, the scale-shaped red crystalline matter on Mortefi's chest continuously expands to cover a larger area of his skin. This transformation is accompanied by a significant rise in body temperature, resulting in the manifestation of intense Frequency Fluctuation. Notably, a fiery apparition resembling a dragon becomes visible behind Mortefi during this stage.\n\nMortefi was the cause of a major fire in Desorock Highland. This event was classified under code EX67891 as a Class 3 hazard. Fortunately, no casualties were reported. Resonator Mortefi's Forte and Overclocking history indicate that negative emotions are his primary trigger for Overclocking, which warrants a higher risk of Overclocking.

The later Tacet Discord encounter during a blizzard caused by Waveworn Phenomenon left frequency erosions to her right eye, leading to Sanhua's abnormal vision and the subsequent Awakening of Forte.\n\nResonator Sanhua's Tacet Mark is located in her right pupil, only visible when she exerts her Forte. After analyzing Sanhua's testimonies and medical tests, we've pinpointed physical changes following her Awakening. These include a chaotic frequency reaction of her right pupil near the Tacet Mark, appearing red. The erosion is also advancing, evident in the color shift from grey to red in her left pupil.\n\nSanhua has gained abnormal vision and control over snow through her Forte, its strength tied to her focus. After analyzing her explanations, our initial conclusion is that her sight differs from the norm, allowing her to perceive object frequencies directly. Frequency tests show 99.64% accuracy in her visualization.\n\nSanhua's Resonance Spectrum Pattern is identical to that of the snow. Additionally, the spectrum patterns of her pupils are identical to the Frequency Fluctuation interval of known TDs. Both tests revealed strong Syntony reactions, and the exact cause of her Awakening remains unclear.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a steep rise in its middle section. Therefore, Sanhua is classified as a Mutant Resonator.",
        "overclockDiagnosticReport": "Resonant Criticality: Very stable. Yet constantly verges on the Criticality level. Risk of Overclocking remains high.\n\nResonator Sanhua has a documented history of Overclocking. Maximum Overclock rating: Moderate.\n\nSanhua's past Overclocks caused Level 2 blizzards due to her extended periods of verging on Resonance Criticality and extreme Frequency Fluctuation reactions. No civilian casualties were reported in these incidents. These series of events are currently documented under code EX01521, classified as Class 3 hazard events.\n\nSanhua's frequency fluctuates due to erosion, causing energy outbursts and altered perception. Her Overclocking leads to quicker erosion spread and changes her left pupil from grey to red.\n\nDue to Resonator Sanhua's past Overclocking tendencies, close monitoring of her psychological and physical condition is advised. Routine counseling and examinations are required."

Unwelcome guests sought more than just a cup of tea, but they would soon learn their mistake: instead of hot tea, they were met with the razor-sharp blade of her bodyguard. The crimson-eyed bodyguard seemed to possess an uncanny ability to detect lies. Within seconds, she transformed into a fearsome Asura ready to strike.",
          "One quick slash revealed shivering limbs as severed trouser legs fell in the cold air. This alone was enough to scare off most of the unwanted guests. Naturally, once the blade returned to its sheath, all shadows and shady dealings would be erased. Jinhsi's radiance would remain untainted, free from contamination.",

Tacet Discords did not take her life, but instead corroded her right eye. The lingering frequencies miraculously reconfigured themselves into a new eye, allowing her, who was born blind, to directly see the frequencies of all things in the world.",

The curse distorted everything in her eyes into grotesque, eerie, and cacophonous apparitions, disturbing her senses and shattering her perception of existence in the world. She saw no lies, but neither did she ever see light.",
          "She relived that snowy night endlessly, struggling to escape hell only to fall back into it again, until she became an Asura herself. In a way, she was never truly rescued from that battlefield. Her world was a painting of purgatory, and she was doomed to be haunted by the Tacet Discords for the rest of her life, unable to break free."

She proposed building a sand wall at the frontline during Tacet Discord assaults. This would shorten the frontlines and limit the attack paths for the enemy. With fewer spots to defend, the Midnight Rangers would have more time to assess each attack and respond accordingly based on the varying frequencies caused by sand deformation.

Following her Awakening, physical changes have been noted, such as the emergence of vines on both ears and dorsal spine.\n\nThese vines form a symbiotic relationship with Verina and assist in converting her resonance frequency into Spectro energy for efficient storage and release during use of Forte.\n\nAdditionally, Verina's Resonance Spectrum Pattern aligns with known patterns of plant life. Strong Syntony reaction have been recorded during testing, yet the exact cause of Verina's Awakening remains inconclusive.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a noticeable periodic waveform.

She was such a big help to us, but we worried about her keeping everything bottled up inside for too long... what if something happened?”",

Verina had all the mushrooms spread out and started naming out all the rings, caps, and butts of each and every one of them. Being out exploring for so long, we all caught on that she was telling us the mushrooms were poisonous. She’s got more knowledge of them than any of us, even gave us a lecture on the spot, teaching us how to tell them apart one by one. Now that was a lesson.”",

Sob...’” She was so panicked that she started picking out the mushrooms still in the pot and went over them again one by one, but we were already all clapping for her. And then I yelled, “Bravo! That’s our little botanist, folks!”",

As frequency fluctuations resurge, limited feather-like transformation have been observed on the ends of her hair.\n\nResonator Yangyang synchronizes with surrounding air by detecting information in air streams and creating an energy field using converging airflow.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Resonator Yangyang displays over 20% resemblance to that of airflow and smaller bird species. White a strong Syntony reaction is present, the pattern also shares over 5% similarity with multiple other existing samples, indicating potential multiple or\ncontaminating causes of Awakening.\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a stable rise. Occasional fluctuations within normal range have been detected. Therefore, Yangyang is identified as a Natural Resonator.",
        "overclockDiagnosticReport": "In terms of Resonant Criticality, Resonator Yangyang ranks at a relatively low level with high stability. Examination results appear to fall within normal parameters with no risk of Overclocking.\n\nResonator Yangyang has a documented history of Overclocking.\n\nMaximum recorded Overclocking rating: Negligible.\n\nDuring the event, Resonator Yangyang experienced emotional overflow and temporary loss of Forte control. Fortunately, there were no casualties or hazards reported, though she suffered several comatose episodes due to the overstimutation. Further examination revealed that Yangyang's heightened perception was causing harm to her body through her Forte. The aftereffects have since stabilized, but the feather-like transformation on the ends of her hair remains irreversible. Yangyang's sensory overload has been managed and her emotional state is stable, with a positive prognosis. Routine examinations are recommended for monitoring purposes."

          "In any social group, there are those who exude a convincing, reliable aura that convinces people they could achieve anything, despite not having started or done it before.",
          "Yangyang is one such person.",
          "“Yangyang? It seems... She can do everything so well.” People would always say so. This trust probably stems from their experiences with her.",
          "Since childhood, Yangyang has excelled in her studies, including etiquette, music, literature, mathematics, and martial arts... She always ranked at the top in all subjects and exams every year. Even when encountering new knowledge or difficult problems, Yangyang never showed frustration; rather, she would actively try to solve any problem that came her way.",
          "Yangyang was always chosen to give speeches at her school’s annual ceremonies. But, like everyone else, she would take a deep breath before speaking, hiding her nerves. Despite having some talent for understanding complex concepts, she lacked true genius. And while others may see her as successful and confident, she struggles just as much with everyday problems.",
          "In her first swordsmanship lesson, she struggled to control her swings and execute proper techniques. Despite this setback, she resolved to work even harder. For the next two months, she practiced 100 times a day and sought guidance from experienced seniors, humbly acknowledging her weaknesses. She then continued to practice with a reflective mindset, improving upon the deficiencies pointed out by others. Eventually, her muscles adapted to the pain and she could withstand several strikes from an opponent",
          "And in another two months, Yangyang, once again, emerged as the top student in her swordsmanship class.",
          "Concerned individuals tried to console Yangyang, reminding her that life is not perfect and that she should be content with the affirmation and praise she receives. But Yangyang would kindly reject this advice, knowing that her drive came from within and not from seeking validation from others.",
          "Was she giving her all? Was everything done to the best of her ability? These were the questions that consumed her.",
          "With a smile and a gentle shake of her head, she would reject any advice to take it easy, determined to push herself to perfection with no room for regrets or shame.",
          "“That’s our Yangyang, doing amazing as always. We knew you’d make it!”",
          "That was when Yangyang became an Outrider and successfully helped resolve a regional TD crisis. People praised her excellence as usual.",
          "“Yes, I did it this time, but how about next time? There are still so many things I could have done better; so many things I don’t know. Perhaps I should go seek advice from senior members of the Midnight Ranger...”",
          "Being consistently reliable is daunting, yet crucial. It takes relentless effort and dedication.",
          "Yangyang is determined to give her all to achieve this goal. She strives to be the one others can seek help from anytime, and won’t stop until she succeeds."

          "Most people didn't know that Yangyang had a perfect pitch.",
          "Perhaps it was because how she was always a passive presence, never singing in public or taking the spotlight. She preferred to stay in the background and listen. It seemed like she was born to be a listener.",
          "That's why Chixia was shocked at Yangyang's ability to accurately hum a melody she had only heard. She couldn't help but exclaim, “How did you memorize that so fast? And it sounded amazing! Good heavens!”",
          "Suddenly, everyone remembered Yangyang's other identity, the second daughter of a family of music. It would be only unnatural if she didn't understand music theory or know how to sing.",
          "This revelation resolved some of the previous confusion. That perfect way of dealing with people, that etiquette which seemed faultless to even the most demanding people. Yes, of course, she had to come from such a well-educated family.",
          "However, it also begged another question: Why would the daughter of such a renowned family go to the border city alone, at the expense of her otherwise luxurious life and promising career? Was there an underlying reason that compelled her to leave?",
          "If there really was such a reason, Yangyang never mentioned it to anyone. She never complained or avoided responsibilities, whether when she fulfilled her Outrider responsibilities, or when she spent time with friends. If one had to say, it was her Outrider companions that bothered her more, because... She was always patiently lending an ear.",
          "Many sought solace in confiding to Yangyang, not seeking solutions but simply venting their stress. She knew this well and remained neutral, empathizing with the narrator's feelings. She listened without interruption, offering guidance when needed before returning to a silent role. With her help, the tangled emotions were untangled unnoticed. These cathartic sessions proved valuable. However, Yangyang's support was not blind agreement; she offered advice prioritizing the speaker's desires.",
          "Soon enough, Chixia told everyone else about Yangyang's amazing talent, sparking playful requests for a song.Yangyang shyly waved off their request, saying, “Maybe... I'll sing it for everyone later, when I am ready?”",
          "Yangyang looked sincere, so it seemed not just perfunctory or an excuse. It was truly what she thought from the bottom of her heart. But when would that be? Perhaps she wanted to wait until everyone else who wanted her to hear out their worries had finished talking?",
          "Understanding and critiquing performances requires a deep knowledge of music. However, being skilled in music does not necessitate taking the stage.",
          "So thought Yangyang, as she again chose to step back, allowing others to shine."

          "To some extent, there isn’t much difference between the sixteen-year-old Yangyang and the six-year-old Yangyang.",
          "She still holds the same expectations for the world, believing in fairy tales as always, believing in the goodness between people, believing in miracles, believing that all things beautiful will eventually happen.",
          "Many would call this naive luck, the thoughts of a spoiled child who has never faced the harsh realities of life.",
          "Indeed, Yangyang grew up in a privileged and nurturing home, shielded from suffering. Her life was perfect...",
          "...Until that fateful day.",
          "At age 11, her tranquil life was shattered by a ruthless attack from Exiles while traveling with her family’s caravan. The brutal reality of death and cruelty left her reeling as she fled and sought refuge among strangers in an unfamiliar settlement. These resilient people lived off the land, cautious yet resourceful. She was forced to fend for herself, adapting to this harsh new world at a young age. She couldn’t tell if they were like the ruthless attackers or not. The constant alertness of these settlers made her question if it was safe to trust anyone. Dressed in fine clothes and alone, she stood out among them, and they too were suspicious of her. Could it be a trap?",
          "In the end, they passed food to her, and she took it, though she’d never seen anything like it.",
          "Kindness found its roots even in the most barren of lands. Yangyang wanted to repay the trust they released before her, but her knowledge proved not helpful at all in the wild, and her sword skills proved too childish against real hostility. Everything seemed entirely unfamiliar to her, yet this was the harsh reality most people had to face. The reality felt so overwhelmingly agonizing.",
          "“Grandma, have you... been living like this all the time?” As Yangyang tried to help an old lady sort out the meager resources they had, she couldn’t help but ask this abrupt question.",
          "“Yes, why? City girl. You shocked? Relax. Everything will be fine.”",
          "“But when? Will things really be fine one day?”",
          "“Of course. How will good things come true if you don’t even believe them yourself? We were skeptical of you, too, but we chose to believe. It’s the same for you. Gotta have faith in something in life. Even if you don’t know how it’ll turn out. That’s what faith is all about.”",
          "“When? Hm, maybe when you grow up, little one.”",
          "So yes, perhaps Yangyang hasn’t experienced enough hardship yet. Or maybe one’s inclination to show kindness isn’t based on past experiences, but inherent in their character.",
          "In the darkest of situations, some will show kindness simply because others chose to trust them. And this in turn will spark more acts of goodwill.",
          "Ever since, Yangyang always spread kindness to strangers, sparked by that one encounter.",
          "Of course, her kindness is not without boundaries. Betrayal can turn her warm breeze into a harsh storm.",
          "But she holds onto hope, believing in the power of goodness. She chooses to trust and expects the best from others. This is her chosen way to make the world a better place."

          "But when the swing went a little too high, Yangyang felt the whispers of wind and sensed an approaching storm, even before she could speak. As she landed, her babbling was mistaken for fear from the accident, but it was actually a reaction to the oncoming tempest.",
          "The second time was when she passed out from sensory overload.",
          "As she grew up, Yangyang’s once vague sensing ability strengthened, allowing her to feel intangible airstreams in her palms. She called them the “Streams” and they gave her insights into energy fluctuations, anomalies, and even the smallest physical details of a person.",
          "Trapped in a self-destructive cycle, Yangyang yearned to explore her ability and gain more insight. But the more she tried to be thorough, the deeper she fell into a maze of details.",
          "What followed cannot be called a fall, for it was a descent through time, not space. The sensory overload lasted for months, between faintness and sobriety. Yangyang felt as light as a feather caught in a raging storm, perpetually falling.",
          "“I must focus on the key details within my reach, rather than trying to capture everything...” Finally, Yangyang pulled herself out of the never-ending free fall and safely landed.",
          "The third, but maybe not the last time, was when Yangyang leaped up and threw herself into the winds.",
          "The continual sensory overload altered her hair and taught Yangyang to tolerate the discomfort. Despite the Streams’ excessive information, the recipient could sift through and extract crucial details. Signs of a struggle at the disappearance site, unusual fluctuations outside the city, and a steady rise in energy reactions...",
          "Yangyang had never used her ability in such a dire situation, but her determination to help overrode any hesitation. The Streams surged, forming a distinct line that led to a missing child, being chased by TDs and teetering on the edge of a cliff. Without hesitation, Yangyang leaped towards the precarious figure, outstretching her hand to save the child.",
          "Feathers danced in the air, carrying Yangyang and the child in a gentle yet powerful wind. The child looked around at the floating feathers and asked, “Are you the lark fairy that flies in the wind, big sister?”",

          "On her journey away from home, Yangyang met two kinds of people.",
          "The first kind always seemed in such haste, yet remained unsure where they were heading, and often ended up lost and returned in regret. The other kind always had a clear destination in mind. They always made it finally, despite arduous roads and occasional stumbles. Yangyang held up her head and looked at Jinzhou city on the horizon, unsure if she could be considered one of the second kind of people. Once again, she thought of the term “One Instrument for Life”.",
          "“One Instrument for Life”. That is the most important principle in Yangyang’s family teachings. Originally, it meant that every family member could strive to excel in everything, but they must choose one musical instrument to specialize in and practice continuously throughout their life to become a master. As circumstances changed, the principle gradually evolved into dedicating one’s entire life to one pursuit, striving for excellence to make this life worthwhile.",
          "Her mother’s Instrument was composing. Yangyang had seen people dancing to her mother’s songs. On the other hand, Yangyang’s sister was already a successful figure in the chamber of commerce.",
          "However, Yangyang could not easily decide her own Instrument as they once did. What was the thing worthy of dedicating her life to? What person should she be?",
          "She turned to her mother for help: Mother, do you want me to inherit the family business? Or, what do you want me to do? I can try anything and I will strive for excellence. Although life is full of infinite possibilities, in the end, we can only choose one path, right?",
          "Her mother looked at her with love and said, my child, it is precisely because of this that you should not seek answers from me, but rather ask your own heart. This is a difficult question, but you need not rush an answer.",
          "And so, Yangyang held onto her question, waiting patiently for an answer that seemed to elude her. She waited through her return home from the desolate settlement, through the climb out of an abyss, and through growing weary of her family’s overprotectiveness. The desire to join the world and experience its harshness grew stronger, no longer content with being a mere leaf drifting in the wind. She longed to bear the weight of reality, instead of hiding away from it.",
          "That was when a sudden ambush in the wilderness resulted in heavy casualties from Tacet Discord attacks on the frontline. News of this tragedy quickly spread through the city, igniting feelings of sorrow, anger, and despair among its inhabitants. Emotions boiled over, with people gathered around a bonfire. Tears flowed freely, hoarse cries echoed through the night. But by morning, grief became a luxury as life returned to normal.",
          "Yangyang stood among them, tears streaming down her face. She hadn’t experienced any personal loss, but witnessing their sorrow and the joy of the rescued children stirred something inside her. It was a transformative moment, as she realized her true calling: to protect others, just as she had been protected before. She wanted to shield them from misfortune and give them hope for a brighter future.",
          "As Yangyang stood at the edge of Jinzhou on her enrollment night as an Outrider, she gazed at the sky and the bustling residents below. Doubt crept in as she questioned her ability to protect these lively citizens, a responsibility she had always dreamed of fulfilling.",
          "The Streams came from afar and gently held Yangyang in their embrace, dispelling her last bits of doubt.",
          "They silently whispered: Jinzhou is the place. It is the destination for Yangyang the wealthy daughter, and the beginning of her journey as Yangyang the Outrider."

Resonator Yuanwu recounted that he was exposed to powerful electrical energy for extended times before his Awakening.\n\nResonator Yuanwu's Tacet Mark is located on the right side of his neck. After his Awakening, blue crystal-like structures appeared on his front limbs, with scar-like tissue visible on his hands and wrists. These changes have since stabilized.\n\nResonator Yuanwu has extraordinary control over the frequency fluctuations of his body. He can engineer the amplitude and range of his frequencies in an instant, seemingly without doing any harm to himself. Tests have concluded that he is 82.58% more proficient in manipulating frequencies than the average Resonator.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Yuanwu has been observed to align closely with that of thunder. A strong Syntony reaction has been observed, yet the cause of Yuanwu's Awakening remains unclear.Analysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a gradual rise. Resonator Yuanwu is thereby classified as a Natural Resonator.",
        "overclockDiagnosticReport": "Resonant Criticality: Relatively high. Resonator Yuanwu's frequency displays high stability with minimal risk of Overclocking.\n\nPrevious records indicate no history of Overclocking; however, in Resonator Yuanwu's adolescence, during the earliest recorded use of his Resonance Ability, there was a near Overclocking event that produced violent frequency fluctuations and uncontrolled behavior. The incident was classified as a Class 2 hazard and archived under code EX42978.\n\nSubsequent examinations revealed that this episode was caused by emotional distress. No aftereffect of Overclocking was noted.\n\nPresently, Resonator Yuanwu's psychological state is deemed stable and healthy. Routine examinations are advised to prevent future incidents of Overclocking."

During his hesitation, a section of the filigree gold rim that adorned the plates went inexplicably missing. He asked all the vendors in Jinzhou, but they either weren’t familiar with imported porcelain or didn’t dare to attempt fixing such valuable items. Mahe was left in a predicament.",

In this relatively tranquil era, the once stringent and harsh customs governing duels gradually waned, making way for more \"amicable\" consultations and exchanges between gyms.",
          "Where people gather, politics inevitably follows. Despite the activities being cloaked under the banner of exchanges, behind the scenes, individuals engaged in secret competitions, employing every means to emerge victorious.

          "On the day of the finals, a surprising surge of thunder filled the air, only to dissipate in an instant. Between the flash and the sudden calm, both suits were struck open. The scorching thunder precisely hit the costumes, avoiding unprotected skin; a little further, and the fighters' joints would have been burned. The exposed inner workings of the broken suits revealed all the clandestine schemes, causing an uproar among the spectators and thus leading to the suspension of the match.",

Seeking solace from the blow to his career, he embarked on a ship tour, only to encounter a fatal thunderstorm.

Since her youth, its been made clear that Jinhsi seeks for a peaceful world and strives to reach out for such an ideal. Being driven, she seeks out those who could support and aid her, such as her mentor, Changli, and isn't afraid to ask for help. Whenever she is presented with a problem, she muses over a solution, and is guided in helping those in need. Throughout her position as Magistrate, Jinhsi would always put others before her, holding no ulterior motives and only wishes to uphold her people's wishes and happiness. Being particularly compulsive to the point where at times she neglects her own health, causing some worry among those who care for her. Jinhsi's earnest wish to bring peace is enough that when faced with a crisis, such as the one coming from Mt. Firmament, she is willing to risk her own life. However, Jinhsi acclaims that while she may endanger herself, she would only do so as a last resort and is willing to find alternative solutions.",
      "Jinhsi is also protective of those she has grown attached towards. From the people of Jinzhou, to Jué, whom she willingly defied if it meant ensuring the Sentinel's life is safe, having no desire for a solution that simply ends in death as the first proposal.  Instead, she decides that defying fate and overcoming the odds as her preferable choice if it means she can protect all she cares for and lead Jinzhou into an age where the Sentinels may not be needed for constant defense. This outlook and her continuous actions in caring for others have thus garnered forth much respect, whereas before many had once doubted her due to her age."

Reports indicate that Resonator Changli displayed early signs of fire manipulation during her childhood, often struggling to control it. However, as Changli matured into adulthood, the frequency and stability of these manifestations notably improved.\n\nResonator Changli's Tacet Mark is situated on her lower chest. Post-Awakening examinations have identified specific alterations in her physical attributes. These include a gradual fading of hair color at the tips and feather-like burn marks on her left arm, emitting a fiery glow influenced by her Forte.\n\nThe Resonance Spectrum Pattern of Changli mirrors the characteristics of fire, displaying a robust Syntony reaction in testing. Despite the exact trigger for her Awakening remaining uncertain, no other sample with a Resonance Spectrum Pattern similarity exceeding 60% has been identified. Resonator Changli's Forte aligns closely with the mythical spirit bird from Huanglong folklore, possibly influenced by her early immersion in tales related to this legendary creature.\n\nResonator Changli possesses the unique ability to compress flames into delicate feather-shaped projectiles. Her Forte, once unleashed, has the power to create scorching fires of exceptional heat, capable of devastating a large area. A telltale sign that her Forte is active is the emergence of a lone fiery feather with an eye-like pattern on her forehead, which she describes as the \"Mind's Eye.\"\n\nAnalysis of test samples has revealed a non-convergent Rabelle's Curve with a stable rise. Occasional fluctuations within normal range have been detected. Therefore, Changli is identified as a Natural Resonator.",

Resonator Changli's frequency displays high stability, and the risk of Overclocking is minimal.\nResonator Changli has a documented history of Overclocking.\n\nMaximum recorded Overclocking rating: Negligible.\n\nAccording to Changli's report, she experienced Overclocking during her childhood due to prolonged exposure to a hazardous environment. This caused her Forte to go into an explosive state multiple times for self-preservation or the protection of others, resulting in a permanent burn mark on her left arm.\n\nHowever, as she grew up and gained more control over her Forte, the frequency fluctuation stabilized and the burn mark did not worsen. There may be irreversible physical damage from the Forte burst, which could potentially shorten Resonator Changli's lifespan.\n\nRegular physical check-ups are recommended, while psychological counseling is not currently necessary."

          "\"Hey, she's a good girl, I kid you not. Helped me out a few days ago, just to get some steamed buns. It's a pity she had to walk here alone, so young and all. I heard her hometown was attacked by the TD Outbreak and no one made it. Not sure how she managed to escape...\"",

          "One day, the girl vanished. Rumors spread—was she taken by Tacet Discords? Or did she succumb to injuries on her journey to the capital city?",

She placed some Shell Credits on the counter and asked with a smile, \"Sir, only you have the books I'm looking for. Please, may I borrow them?\"",

          "Master Xuanmiao had been looking for a certain person.",
          "Young Changli accompanied her aged mentor across the landscapes of Huanglong. Though he was initially reluctant to mentor another student, the revered elder dedicated himself to passing on every ounce of wisdom to her in their limited time together.",
          "Master Xuanmiao was a devoted Weiqi player. During breaks on their weary journey, they would settle by the roadside to engage in intense matches. He utilized these moments not just for play but also as teaching opportunities for Changli, imparting wisdom on strategic thinking and power dynamics within each move. Sometimes, he would analyze an unfinished game of Weiqi with her, but he always seemed somewhat dissatisfied with her responses.",
          "It was during these times that he would mention an old friend of his, hinting at a quest to reconnect with this individual through Changli's tutelage. Despite Changli's curiosity about this mysterious person's identity and location, her mentor would simply shake his head and tell her, \"The time has not yet come.\"",
          "On the day he felt his final moments approaching, he entrusted Changli with his Weiqi game record and his cherished journal. With solemnity, he told his devoted disciple, \"In this unfinished game, you shall find the ultimate truth.\"",
          "And so, carrying on the legacy of Master Xuanmiao, Changli embarked on her path ahead.",

          "\"...Steadfastly by the side of Sentinel Jué, in a bond of intimate camaraderie.\"",
          "Following the notes in her late mentor's journal, she continued her search, uncovering traces of that enigmatic figure in various unexpected places. At times, it was the captivating tales spun by seasoned storytellers; elsewhere, it was mere slivers gleaned from ancient archives. Like a silent guardian, this person acted as a sturdy anchor in turbulent seas, leading humanity through the wreckage of past calamities towards a hopeful horizon. The subtle imprints they left behind wove an almost imperceptible yet unyielding thread that bridged vast stretches of time and history far surpassing the ordinary span of mortal lives.",
          "She had been told that the signs of that person's arrival would be impossible to miss. That said person had the power to truly change the world. However, her vision of a peaceful and prosperous world required more than mere hopeful anticipation of a savior. Understanding that achieving her dreams necessitated acquiring substantial power and influence, she embarked on a journey through diverse lands, immersing herself in wisdom, and persisting through every challenge without faltering to meet the expectations placed upon her.",
          "Upon assuming the esteemed role of Secretary-General, she at last gained entry into the revered Grand Libraries. Within the vast expanse of knowledge stored within their walls, she uncovered a pivotal revelation: a clue leading her to Jinzhou, a border city in Huanglong.\nFrom then on, everything unfolded precisely as Sentinel Jué predicted. The person she had been searching for emerged in Jinzhou and protected the city from a reviving Threnodian. The once nebulous being from ancient records and myths now solidified into a clear and distinct presence within her mind.",
          "On the day of their foretold encounter, she returned to Jinzhou from Mingting, the capital city of Huanglong. She witnessed the esteemed guest of Jinzhou waiting at the ferry port in the rain, looking uncertain.",
          "Following the prophecies of Jué, she had faith that their paths would converge at the right moment.",
          "And that awaited moment was upon her.",
          "Concealing a whirlwind of emotions behind her gaze, she advanced towards them with measured steps. Using her paper umbrella adorned with a spirit bird motif, she gently angled it to provide cover from the rain, as their eyes locked in a wordless exchange. The sole audible presence was the hushed melody of raindrops tapping against her umbrella.",
          "She smiled and softly asked, \"Are you trapped here by the rain?\""

The woman, absorbed in selecting jewelry to wear, stole a fleeting glance at the artwork. \"Impressive, Zhezhi,\" she murmured with a brief smile. Delighted by the praise, the girl inched closer. \"The people in this one are—\" Her words faltered as her mother turned, absorbed in wardrobe choices, oblivious to her daughter's attempt at connection. \"Well done. Now, why don't you paint a few more before the guests arrive?\" Zhezhi blinked, at a loss for words. Her mother grew impatient, sighing as she marched Zhezhi to the door. \"Buy whatever supplies you need, dear. The price doesn't matter, we can afford it. Now, I need to dress. Be a good girl. Off you go.” As the door closed, Zhezhi stared at it, wanting to say more but unable to find the courage to voice the sinking feeling in her chest.",

The woman noted Zhezhi's unease, the sight of it triggering memories of their family's past struggles and humble beginnings. She strode forward, taking Zhezhi's hand and leading her into the center of attention. \"Didn't you know? Zhezhi was gifted from the day she was born. Her paintings were chosen for exhibitions even before we hired a tutor.\" With a painted smile, she mimicked the grace of the upper class. \"Would you care for a painting too? Zhezhi can finish one in a day.\" Zhezhi shrank inwardly, wishing to disappear, only to be thrust forward. \"Show everyone your skills, Zhezhi.\" All eyes turned to her, leaving Zhezhi trembling, unable to paint a single stroke.",

Just before knocking, she overheard their conversation inside.\n\"Did you know? That painting sold for 400,000 Credits today. With this money, we can fulfill the paused order.\"\n\"Right.

That's different...\" Zhezhi hesitated for a moment, seeing the girl hard at work. \"Let me help you with that...\" The girl met Zhezhi's eyes with a twinkle. \"Sure! Thanks for offerin'! Here, use this sickle, I'll go grab another one!\"",
          "Zhezhi stared in confusion at the sickle promptly shoved into her hands. But she soon squatted down among the tall vegetables, mimicking the farm girl's movements. \"Wait, wait. You won't get anywhere doin' it like that. Here, lemme show ya!\"",
          "Under the hot sun, the two girls worked together to harvest the field until they reached its end. Exhausted, they lay under a tree to rest. Zhezhi forgot about the mud on her shoes and the dirt on her expensive dress, lost in the joy of spending time with her new friend. The carefree laughter between them filled her heart with ease and brought a true smile to her lips.",

It made me realize what my paintings were missing. This is my best work, and it's for you! I hope you like it! Maybe next week, I can sneak out to help again.\"",

As a reward for Zhezhi's obedience in using her Forte to paint and help save the family business, her parents bought her a pet bird as a surprise. Every day, Zhezhi watched the bird beat its wings against the cage until it was exhausted. After much hesitation, one day she boldly defied her parents and released the bird from its captivity. After her parents disappeared, Zhezhi sold off the family's remaining belongings, keeping only the birdcage as a memento. Whenever she looked at it, she didn't see the bars but the bird that had long since flown free."

          "Years later, I found myself standing at that door again.\nThe Xiangli family had always been a star in Jinzhou's journalistic circles. Back then, doing a piece on the family was considered an honor, and indeed, their scientific heritage continues to produce admirable accomplishments. The last time I stood on this doorstep, I was still a rookie, eager for recognition, and the Xianglis helped me with just that by allowing me to take their family portrait. A piece that ticked all the boxes.\nThe photo won me a small award and secured my job.\nAs the door opened, I looked down to see a boy with bright and clear eyes looking back at me. I flashed my press badge, and he ushered me inside.\nXiangli Yao, the \"Son of the Genius\" and \"Paragon's Descendant.\" His father's brilliance had turned heads across Jinzhou, and his mother's perseverance saved the lives of countless children in the city.\nThis very house once drew the attention of many, and it remains that way to this day.\nI prided myself on conducting interviews, but this young boy seemed more comfortable than I was. Xiangli Yao, like his parents, possessed a natural eloquence, his demeanor gentle and poised. The interview flowed smoothly, and after setting aside my notebook, he offered me a cup of tea. I thanked him, but he shook his head.\n\"I should thank you for visiting because of my parents,\" Xiangli Yao smiled, \"I've heard a thing or two about what's been happening.\"\nJinzhou, with its vast lands and rich resources, is not without its share of discord.\nThe Xianglis had done me a favor in the past, one I felt compelled to repay, both professionally and personally by making sure their son was okay. Xiangli Yao smiled wistfully, his expression hinting at a memory relived. \"My parents are always busy with work, so I'm glad someone remembers them. Your reports capture their moments, research results, words spoken, and many other details that I didn't even know about... When I read those news and interviews, I feel like I get to know them better.\"\nI hesitated for a moment but still went on to ask.\n\"Do you think... it's unfair? That perhaps your parents should have spent more time with their child?\"\n\"They both have their passions, and it's the same for me. I'm happy they're doing what they love.\"\n\"...Is that so.\"\nI took a deep breath and prepared to leave, but Xiangli Yao asked me to stay. I forgot the exact reason he gave. However, I'm sure it must've been a good one. Xiangli Yao had a way with words that made refusing his hospitality difficult. I only remember having another cup of warm tea and continuing to chat for a while before finally taking my leave.\nAs I reached for the door, the boy remarked with a straight face, \"If there's anything you want to confirm, it's best to do it in person. When I was little, my mother and I often talked about the importance of companionship—we even exchanged small notes. Though I was still very young then, those notes, with their few simple words... I find them just as comforting today.\"\nI nodded and left the house, ready to pen my next piece.\nBut before that, I would send a message to my child, whom I had neglected to contact for several days."

          "Xiangli Yao leaned forward in his chair and stared resolutely at the elderly man in front of him.\nThe older man held a prestigious position in the education system and had personal connections with Xiangli Yao's father. Today, it was another attempt at persuasion, much like the previous ones.\n\"I am not attending a separate class. Regular school is fine for me,\" Xiangli Yao reiterated.\nThe elderly man tapped on the table, \"Your current pace might not fit into the standard curriculum. Moving too quickly can bring challenges. You and your classmates are not on the same playing field.\"\nXiangli Yao shook his head.\n\"There's no point wasting resources opening a special class just for me. I already have access to the Jinzhou archives for study. Besides... I'm just like the others,\" he said, counting on his fingers, \"I have a great time watching hero plays with them, and we trade cards... Oh, and when they invite me over for dinner, I get to test my gadgets out on them and get their feedback!\"\nThe elder sighed deeply. \"Your teacher has mentioned such things to me. He says you get along well with your classmates. But this isn't just about you, it's about getting you into the Academy faster,\" he said, staring at the young person before him. \"Xiangli Yao, your father also accelerated his studies and had more time to conduct all the research he loved.\"\n\"I am not my father.\"\n\"Yet you share his talents and temperament. That I've noticed.\"\nXiangli Yao gripped the textbooks in his hands, as he slowly and firmly shook his head, \"But that's not what I want. I want to take things slow, like the way it is now.\"\n\"Playing trivial games with your classmates won't do you any good... You'll tire of it sooner or later. It's a waste of time.\"\nThe elder stood by the window, looking out at students playing and laughing in the schoolyard. Xiangli Yao went to him, patting his shoulder.\n\"That won't happen,\" Xiangli Yao said softly, also looking at the same view. \nThey were his friends.\n\"I want to be like them, going to school, talking about snacks, catching fish in the river, and watching cool Echoes. Hey, they even taught me when and how to smile and compliment someone. That's important to me. I know you mean well, but... I get to decide what's best for me, right?\"\nOld and young faced each other in the silent office.\nThe elder sighed again. \"You remind me of your father. But the two of you are not quite the same.\"\nXiangli Yao smiled, \"Well, like I said... I'm not my father. I'm not the student you once had.\"\nThe door opened again.",

          "\"Here. Another package of yours.\"\nHis friend placed the box in a forgotten corner of the dorm, then sprawled out in bed, \"Xiangli Yao, you should definitely sign up for Lollo Logistics membership. With how often you've been getting these deliveries, it's worth it.\"\nXiangli Yao turned his chair to face his friend, \"Haha. I'll think about it.\"\n\"Latest issue?\"\n\"Yeah, they sent me a sample.\"\n\"Jealous! I wish I could work that fast, popping out articles left and right while taking classes at the same time. Man.\" He waved his arms and grinned, \"I guess you already have that Imperial Academy exam in the bag. So, where's it gonna be?\"\nWith that, he tossed over a can of soda.\nThe can drew a perfect arc in the air, landing squarely in Xiangli Yao's hand.\n\"Too much sugar,\" sighed the model student, known for his healthy habits as his lips quirked into a smile, cracking open the can anyway. \"About that...\"\nA brief silence followed. Then Xiangli shook his head softly. \"I haven't decided yet.\"\nHis friend raised an eyebrow, surprised. \"Well, that's new. I thought you made up your mind already. Professors must be fighting over you.\" \n\"There are a few things I haven't figured out yet.\"\n\"Which are...?\"\n\"Boundaries. The boundaries of truth,\" Xiangli Yao said slowly, twisting a cube in his hands. \"Pascar, do you suppose that humanity will hold itself back in pursuing the boundaries of truth?\"\n\"Maybe. There are plenty of nut job scientists out there, so who knows.\"\n\"We chase after the stars, only to fall beneath them. Boundaries limit our scope... but without it, there's no way to tell whether you're progressing.\"\n\"Well... you and I have different opinions on this, and I'll keep mine to myself to avoid an argument. But what's all this got to do with your admission? You trying to change the subject on me?\"\nXiangli Yao smiled softly. \"It does. After my father pursued his own path, I've heard little about him. But I've uncovered some leads... Perhaps they'll lead me to the Court of Savantae, the place he went searching for.\"\n\"You sure you're going? After so many years, plenty of people have tried to find even a smither of hint related to the CSC, with little success.\"\n\"I feel that I must go. Even if I'll end up finding nothing. I want to know...\" \nThe young scholar spoke slowly, his voice gradually softened, \"I want to know... if my father crossed that boundary.\"",
          "A month before exams, Xiangli vanished.\nHe left behind a video, revealing his confusion and the sense of emptiness he felt on his path of pursuing the truth. But whichever path he chose henceforth, he would embrace its outcome.\nEmpty seats lingered in the dorm, as life carried on."

          "It took over ten days to get inside the ruins.\nAt every step, remnants of the Court of Savantae's defenses were giving Xiangli Yao a hard time. Despite his meticulous preparations, some supplies and provisions had been lost along the way.\nXiangli Yao assessed what remained, weighing his options, and ultimately chose to press deeper into the ruins.\nHe had long since departed from the borders of Huanglong, and returning a second time to explore further would prove highly difficult. After surveying the soil upon arrival, the young scholar conjectured that these ruins, like those before, had little time left.\nInternally, however, conditions were far better. The bulk of the instruments were well-preserved and intact. Cerulean fluids surged and circulated in the conduits of all the mechanisms with a vitality outlasting their creators. Each mechanism, precise, robust, and elegant, was meticulously cataloged by Xiangli Yao as he discerned subtle deviations from Huanglong's existing technologies.\nThe more he explored, the more an irrepressible thrill seized him. Like a poet enraptured by fine wine, Xiangli Yao felt drunk on the outpouring of knowledge that surrounded him.\nHis Terminal had lost its connection to the outside world, but he still did his best to record everything. His fascination with mechanics, a domain where Savantae had made unparalleled strides, led him to wonder whether his father had known of these innovations, and where he was now on the path of chasing the stars.\nYet amid the marvels, signs of a strange intrusion became apparent. Ever since the Lament, most technologies should have reverted back to their rudimentary states. But here, structures once familiar bore alien marks of alteration, defying erosion yet imbued with an elegance surpassing even Savantae's other creations.\nThe deeper Xiangli Yao went into the ruins, the anomalies intensified. Xiangli Yao's recordings slowed. The need to distinguish between anomalies and original designs demanded meticulous care. Eventually, he landed on a guess: The people here were trying to create some sort of door.\nA door. A gateway. A... portal.\nFor the first time, Xiangli Yao hesitated.\nBesides the danger, the doubt was about direction. So far, no alternate passage into the ruins had revealed itself, suggesting his father's departure had taken a different path. Had his father fallen here? Or...\nIf truth had a path, perhaps this was its nearest gateway."

          "Later, when Xiangli Yao reflected on his journey through the Court of Savantae ruins, he realized that parts of his memory had become foggy. He suspected it was due to the effects of the ancient mechanisms and force fields—devices that transcended current technological limits and boasted near-unfathomable levels of advancement. Creating them was clearly unwise, at least for the CSC researchers. Since the Lament, exploration beyond had halted due to the warping of the laws of physics. Yet, many scholars still yearned to traverse the skies again and explore interstellar space.\nThat portal might have been built for that very purpose: to leap into the sky, or perhaps even further, into the heart of the civilization that had transformed these ruins.\nXiangli Yao wasn't sure if they had succeeded, but he paid a steep price for his curiosity—his arm. He could only speculate that he had managed to solve the sequence and activate the mechanism. He recalled the marks etched into the enormous cavity. They were rugged and twisted, as if a huge Tacet mark was carved onto it.\nThen, crystalline, delicate butterflies emerged from the fracture. A strange power seeped from the gap, glowing with the mysteries of another civilization. As Xiangli Yao stared into it, past barriers that once seemed insurmountable now appeared solvable within this new framework. The waves of knowledge surged, capable of bending, subduing, and intertwining all frequencies in existence.\nHe took a step forward, almost forgetting the blood gushing from his torn flesh. The dizziness from blood loss and a faint euphoria blurred his senses.\nAt that moment, he noticed a familiar object lying dust-covered on the workstation. His childhood memories were hazy, but he recognized it immediately as a gift from his mother to his father. Xiangli Yan had once shown it to him as a child, a father and son photo of them together. Suddenly, he understood. Even at the end, his father held onto a memory of their family. He hadn't abandoned everything.\nBeyond that threshold, could he still see himself progressing, at the end of pure theory where no one could observe…?\nHis father devoted everything to theoretical science, his mother to applied science. Xiangli Yao was like them, always longing to reach for the stars, even willing to burn himself in the process.\nThey had given their all.\nAnd what about him?\nStanding just a step away from the ultimate answer, the young scholar found himself thinking about trivial, unrelated things. He recalled how, after his parents' departure, friends and neighbors had dragged him out to join a Jinzhou festival. It was supposed to be the Moon-Chasing Festival, but the threat from the Threnodian had forced a simpler celebration. Yet, a festival is always a festival, a reminder to celebrate even in hard times. He had demonstrated one of his newest creations, a small gadget, which won applause from the crowd.\nHe was like his parents.\nHowever, he was not their clone. Even as his shadow followed theirs, he found himself unable to journey the same roads they had traveled.\nWith trembling hands, the young scholar searched for scattered parts, trying to assemble a device to stop the bleeding. His newly acquired Forte gently surged and began to warp the metal structures according to his will.\nAs the bleeding ceased, so did the grand opportunity before him.\nIt was only a few steps away... but Xiangli Yao had already turned his back.\nHe knew he had found his own answer."

As the head of the organization, The Shorekeeper embraces the moniker \"The Shorekeeper\" wholeheartedly, as it encapsulates her mission and purpose.",
      "The Shorekeeper exudes a refined elegance, her physical beauty enhanced by the regal aura that surrounds her. She carries herself with grace and poise, her every movement a dance of subtlety and charm. Her fair skin and blue-purple eyes, adorned with a hint of red and blue, add an alluring mystique to her already captivating presence. The Shorekeeper is a picture of elegance and beauty, her countenance a testament to her grace and refinement.",
      "In a brave and selfless act, Shorekeeper sacrifices herself to ensure that Rover can continue on their journey. With great bravery and courage, she steps forward to protect them, knowing that she may not survive the ordeal. As she makes this sacrifice, a deep sense of determination and resolve seeps through every fiber of her being, filling her with a strength that surpasses her physical bounds.",
      "Under Rover's guidance, Shorekeeper also became aware that the Black Shores wasn't the sole focus of her duty. As they formed a bond and learned from each other, Shorekeeper came to understand that her dedication and responsibility extended beyond the confines of her position within the organization. Rover's love and support helped her realize that her true purpose was not limited to her role in the Black Shores, but could include other meaningful commitments and connections.",
      "In a touching moment during a quest, Shorekeeper finally declared her enduring love for Rover and tenderly bid them farewell, expressing her deepest emotions. This heartfelt admission and the impending separation conveyed the depth of Shorekeeper's affection and the profound significance of their bond. As their paths diverged, the words of goodbye lingered in the air, tinged with a bittersweet mix of grief and hope."

However, the Remnant Energy within her has shown signs of dissipation multiple times, leading to excessive energy loss and crystal fragmentation. This may be attributed to the processing of Lament data via massive computation. Notably, the Shorekeeper has detected these issues and has attempted to mitigate the damage by replacing her damaged parts with new energy crystals. The string-like wave marks on her shoulders and calves are likely scars from this healing process.\n\nThe possibility of this issue recurring cannot be ruled out, which may require increased monitoring and more frequent replacement of the energy crystals.\nIf the ▇▇▇ test results exceed controllable limits, alternative contingency plans may need to be implemented."

They blessed them, wishing they would lead them to a brighter tomorrow. Yet this lonely odyssey required a timeless vessel to complete the Reverberations, and the best they could offer was an enduring tool. Thus, the Shorekeeper was born—a deliberate creation, a light blue crystal cocoon of Remnant Energy gathered from the Anchor.",
          "The Shorekeeper knew what needed to be done long before she understood how. But a tool needs a guide. She waited aimlessly in the void until, as the sea surged to its edge, she sensed a heartbeat drawing near in the briny sea breeze.",
          "In the stillness of the night, the Astral Modulator surveyed the land as the Lament's roars faded into the distance, leaving only their steady heartbeat.",
          "\"Perhaps the underground needs a sky as brilliant as the one above...\" the Modulator mused, planning the future. As they reached out to activate the Tethys System, an enigmatic allure from a blue crystal beckoned them closer. The meeting of their frequencies triggered a resonance that shattered the crystal, releasing a surge of energy that burst forth like a nebula or a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis.",

          "Before being confined underground as the core of Tethys, the Shorekeeper once traveled beyond the Black Shores.",
          "At that time, civilization was steadily advancing. The Astral Modulator had established an organization called the Black Shores, recruiting new members selected by Tethys. Meanwhile, the Shorekeeper focused on recreating and analyzing the Reverberations they brought back, completing her calculations.",
          "Like an omniscient observer, the Shorekeeper could trace data to monitor any human's behavior at any time in her recreated Sonoros. She attempted to categorize and interpret humans like any other phenomenon, but quickly found herself perplexed by them.",
          "Why do they cry in both joy and sorrow? Why do their actions so often contradict their desires? Why pursue something they know they'll regret, or persist in the impossible? How can they so easily harm others, yet sacrifice themselves without hesitation? Every time the Shorekeeper thought she was closer to understanding, an unexpected event would overturn her conclusions. Though confused, she wondered if this confusion even mattered—after all, it didn't stop her from completing her tasks. But then, the Astral Modulator gave her a mission: signs of an impending Lament had appeared, which required field research to gather data for analysis. They would go together and... see what more could be done.",
          "The Shorekeeper followed the Modulator through the farmland of that region. It was harvest season—the soil underfoot was soft yet firm, the hanging heads of grain full and ripe, and the wind carried the sweet scent of rice. She understood these things, yet seeing them firsthand felt different. Lost in these unfamiliar sensations, the Shorekeeper was unaware that her expression mirrored the curiosity and wonder of a child stepping out of their home for the first time. The Modulator chatted warmly with the locals, their conversations filled with dialects and the hum of everyday life. A kind old woman offered them homemade food. Her skin was rough, while the baby she held had warm, sweaty fingers.",
          "But just as Tethys predicted, the omens soon became reality, shattering the fleeting peace.",
          "The once-friendly people fell into despair—fighting over resources, crying out in anguish, their faces twisted with desperation and fear. For the first time, the Shorekeeper witnessed the Lament herself, not through Sonoros, but in its raw, overwhelming reality.",
          "What surprised her even more was the Modulator. They led all the Resonators in resisting the Tacet Discords, encouraging everyone to hold on until reinforcements arrived. They were trying to alter a predetermined future, but why go to such lengths for a group of strangers? The Shorekeeper recalled the Tethys System's instructions:",
          "\"A future that has been altered is destined to be altered. Attempting to change predetermined outcomes should be avoided.\"",
          "\"I can't just stand by and do nothing. If this is the cost of reaching tomorrow, I question whether such a tomorrow is worth it.\" The golden-eyed Modulator's voice was firm.",
          "\"…Unable to process. But I will prioritize your needs,\" the Shorekeeper responded, as she expanded the Stellarealm to heal and protect.",
          "Night fell, and reinforcements finally arrived. Just as they prepared to leave, a child who had lost his parents blocked their path.",
          "\"W-wait, where are you going? I want to go with you… to fight those monsters!\"",
          "Seeing the child's bright eyes, the Modulator crouched down and pointed to the Blake Bloom on their attire.",
          "\"What we're about to do is too dangerous for you. But if you still want to join us when you grow up, look for someone wearing this flower.\"",
          "As the ship sailed away, the Shorekeeper watched the child waving from the dock. Humans still perplexed her, but this time, she tried to express her confusion to the one beside her.",
          "\"Tethys didn't predict this. That child isn't a candidate we need.\"",
          "\"Not everything requires Tethys's command. Humans aren't bound by such restrictions. He may not be needed now, but in time… he'll find his own path.\"",

          "When the robots mentioned the name \"Delone,\" the Shorekeeper immediately recalled all that was tied to it. This wasn't just due to her natural ability to store and record information, but because Delone was special—she was one of the few who sought out the Black Shores herself.",
          "The first time the Shorekeeper met her, Delone was a spirited girl, brimming with enthusiasm. She had complained about how hard it was to find the Black Shores, then raised her eyebrows with a hint of pride. \"I knew it! Others must be gathering to fight against the Laments and prevent further anomalies!\"",
          "At that time, the Astral Modulator, who once held the highest authority in the Black Shores, had not yet been absent for long, and the Shorekeeper was still able to visit the surface. When the eager girl had grabbed her hand, her determination to join the Black Shores palpable, the Shorekeeper had been unsure how to respond. She felt the girl's warm hand—hot, just like the fire in her eyes.",
          "The Shorekeeper granted Delone eligibility to sit for the entrance exam, despite it deviating from Tethys's recruitment protocols. The Shorekeeper remembered what the Modulator had once said to her, \"Humans aren't bound by such restrictions… We aren't data or abstract concepts stored in records.\" The Shorekeeper believed the Modulator would probably have acted similarly, just to preserve the girl's burning enthusiasm. In the end, Delone passed the exam and became an official member of the Black Shores.",
          "The Shorekeeper never imagined that they would meet again under such tragic circumstances.",
          "More than a decade had passed, and the once fiery girl had matured into a composed woman. But now, she was reaching out to the Shorekeeper with a trembling hand, life sweeping away from a grievous wound. The Shorekeeper saw it clearly. Delone's life was fading away, and there was only one possible outcome.",
          "\"I did it,\" Delone said with a weak smile. \"I took down eight Tacet Discords in one go during the Lament. But Twala... they weren't so lucky. I was the only one left to bring the data back.\"",
          "The time for farewell was drawing near. The other members, unaware of the Shorekeeper's true identity, assumed she was a close friend of Delone and gave them space for a final moment together.",
          "\"So much time has passed... I'm... I'm so old now... but you're just the same as before.\"",
          "\"Did I do well? I didn't disappoint you, did I?\" Delone's voice wavered with weakness, but her eyes still shone as brightly as they did when they first met. What would the Modulator have done? The Shorekeeper didn't know—there was no clear answer, no example to follow. But looking into those eyes, she felt something heavy in her chest, an indescribable emotion surging within her. It compelled her to break protocol once again, just as she had done all those years ago.",
          "\"You've done well. Very well.\"",
          "The Shorekeeper answered, and this time, she held Delone's hand. Somehow, she knew this gesture might bring comfort to her, just as it had so many years ago.",
          "\"Thank you... Thank you, Shorekeeper,\" Delone whispered, deep relief in her voice. Then, she murmured, \"The stars... they're so bright. Will I become one of them... after this? There's so much I won't be able to see, but you will... they will...\"",
          "A tear fell from her eye, taking with it her last warmth.",
          "Just as Delone had said, the Shorekeeper transformed the frequencies of the departed into a \"star,\" leaving them within the constellations of data. She couldn't remember when she had started doing this. Time had withered the Blake Blooms and eroded the Black Shores—it had also taken the lives of those who deserved to be remembered. The ever-shining stars in the sky had become the only resting place for these fallen souls.",
          "Under the starlit sky, the Shorekeeper stood on the shores, bathed in their glow, and gazed across the sea. Had the Modulator been right to entrust her with such authority? Had she done enough to look after the Black Shores as instructed? The answers to these questions lay with the one who had left... All that remained for her was the seemingly endless wait. And so, she waited, for time was the one thing she had in abundance."

          "On the busiest street in Jinzhou, a small appraisal stall occasionally appears, adding a touch more excitement to the bustling scene.The stall owner is a lively girl Youhu who confidently considers herself a seasoned appraiser. She claims that with just a light touch, she can discern the history behind any antique. Her early career saw just one slip-up—misjudging an ancient Ding. She later purchased it from the client, repaired it with her cryogenic powers, and now keeps it close as a reminder to stay sharp.Despite her playful self-promotion and carefree antics, people don't mind trusting her, especially since her appraisal fees are modest—just the cost of a meal and a sprinkle of compliments.\"This folding screen predates Jinzhou, a rare treasure perfectly preserved! You can even call it a witness to Jinzhou's rise and fall!”\"The glaze here? Smooth as jade, soft as silk. It's not ancient, but the craftsmanship is definitely worth the price!\"Her insights, whether on artistry or historical value, hit the mark every time, earning her the trust of her clients.Adding to the charm of her appraisals is a unique flair—call it a show, if you will.While others might inspect antiques with magnifying glasses, Youhu examines each piece with lively gestures, reciting witty poems as if she's performing some ancient, mysterious ritual.Initially, people worried she might accidentally damage their valuables, but after seeing her skills, they've come to embrace her eccentric ways. Perhaps true masters just have their... well, quirks."

          "Youhu always carries a scroll-like box filled with miniature replicas of antiques she's appraised, each crafted with her Forte. These replicas aren't just souvenirs, but handy tools to fend off Tacet Discords. In the summer, they can double as coolers. Just pop some fruit in with an iced replica, and voilà—a chilled snack!Inside the box is also a booklet where she writes limericks about every antique she encounters:\"A guy from the Ministry of Development asked me to find that missing enameled porcelain from Huanglong. Noted!\"\"That merchant definitely got the celadon tripod incense burner through shady means! I hinted he should return it, but who knows if he'll listen. Better keep an eye on him.\"\"That carpenter at the city gate is chopping wood with a centuries-old knife! The audacity! What a disgrace! I'll... let it slide this time. Just need to tell him the knife's true worth later.\"These interesting notes help keep her memories fresh.Take that merchant with the incense burner. After weeks of strange events and sleepless nights, he recalled the street appraiser's warning:\"Haiya, that incense burner's from a bad place! Your luck won't hold up against it—misfortune's coming your way!\"She had said it with such flair, like a storyteller spinning a tall tale. The merchant hadn't taken her seriously at first, but his recent misfortunes made him reconsider.One night, after the fifteenth eerie shadow flitted outside his window with its bone-chilling shriek, he rushed to return the stolen burner.Had he dared to look up, he might have seen another scene unfolding:The Patrollers had spotted a suspicious figure on the rooftops and moved in to question them.Youhu, dressed in a makeshift disguise, saw the guards approaching and fled, stumbling a few times along the way.Even as she ran, she managed to jot down in her booklet: \"Celadon tripod incense burner, returned to its rightful place.\""

          "Youhu was born in a bustling port town known for its antique trade, where her parents were both esteemed appraisers.On her first birthday, her parents, following local customs, surrounded her with objects representing various trades. It was said that the first item the child touched would predict their future interests and career path.But that day, little Youhu ignored pens, swords, and cooking utensils, crawling straight to her mother to latch onto the family's precious heirloom—a genuine antique Ruyi ring—and refused to let go.Growing up surrounded by antiques, Youhu's love for them blossomed. She was fascinated by everything about them, soaking up the driest, most obscure appraisal facts with a twinkle in her eye. But what she loved most was listening to the stories her parents told about the antiques.The deep chimes of the ancient bell echoed with memories of distant times when people knelt in devotion before golden statues praying for their family's wellbeing.The stone carvings depicted bold youths drawing their bows, warding off Tacet Discords to protect the people.Youhu's lively nature shone through as she immersed herself in the world of antiques, the Tacet Mark on her arm glowing faintly to illuminate her eyes.In every antique, she saw a little piece of history and a glimpse into the remnants of a civilization. This magic still holds her spellbound today.Chenpi, Youhu's master, often praised her talent. \"To be honest, your knowledge of antiques lacks structure. But don't worry, I'll teach you everything you need to know.\"\"What's truly valuable is your respect for the history in these antiques and your keen perception. In other words, you're a natural appraiser.\"And Youhu would flash a cheeky grin, \"Pfft, my parents already said I was born for this.\""

          "The so-called renowned appraisers are always squabbling over the value of antiques.First, they downplay an antique's value, snapping it up for a pittance, only to turn around and hype it up to sell for a fortune. Craftsmanship? History? Mere afterthoughts in their pricing games.However, Youhu has a different approach. For her, the worth of an antique isn't measured solely in currency, but something more unique.Genuine appreciation is the first factor. Youhu enjoys facilitating deals where buyers are deeply respectful of the antiques and sellers entrust their cherished items to someone who truly appreciates them. As the antique changes hands, its frequency is mirrored in the hearts of both parties.Another factor would be conscience. When Youhu was seven, raiders ransacked the town looking for riches. To them, antiques were just another form of loot.The wealthy merchants and local appraisers panicked, abandoning their treasures as they escaped.The raiders, ignorant about the true worth of these antiques, justified their plundering by saying the people here didn't deserve their treasures anyway, and such items might as well be taken somewhere they would be appreciated.But not everyone fled. Some stood their ground, facing the raiders with steely resolve. They knew the true value of these antiques and defended them to the bitter end.And that brings us to the final factor. The courage to sacrifice.Now, it is Youhu's turn to make a sacrifice. Whether it is her talent, her knowledge, or the lengths she will go to recover them, she is determined to return every lost antique back to its rightful owner.In the past, those who couldn't see the value in these relics trampled all over them. But today, Youhu's mission is to return each lost antique to where it truly belongs."

          "Over the course of examining countless antiques, Youhu has developed a habit of replicating her favorites with her cryogenic powers.She once made an ice chime. It didn't quite match the original's melody, but the crisp sound of shattering ice was delightful in its own way. She also crafted an ice Ruyi, swinging it with such gusto that she nearly smashed the nearby ice cauldron and mask!People often ask about her most treasured antique. Youhu always hesitates, her eyes fixed on the Ruyi ring before her. This is her family's heirloom—once shattered, but now pieced together with ice.Her mother had told her that the Ruyi ring symbolized completeness and good fortune. Youhu was mesmerized by the clear and translucent jade. But when raiders came, she could only watch as the ring and other treasures were pillaged and shipped away.Three years later, she found those plundered items displayed as trophies in a museum. Despite an exhaustive search, the Ruyi ring was nowhere to be found.It wasn't until she stumbled into a dusty storage room that she found the ring's shattered fragments, along with a tag that read \"Low value, not for display.\" What she valued most was dismissed by those who didn't understand its true worth.Heartbroken yet determined, Youhu clutched the fragments and trudged through knee-deep snow, her tears freezing as they fell. Driven by a sudden thought, she ignored the biting cold, crouched down, and used her Forte to piece the ring back together from the ice before losing consciousness.When she awoke, her hands were etched with delicate snowflake patterns. The next thing she saw was a perfect, gleaming ice Ruyi ring lying beside her, as if it had been waiting for her all along."

      "At Camellya's core, she is someone who seeks entertainment and fun for her own amusement. In contrast to her fellow Black Shore members, Camellya views her employment as an obligation and little else. She is a hedonist that has a great joy for finding those she considers \"promising seeds\", and hunts them down to sate her pleasure in battle. She extends this interest in not just recruits the Tethys System considers as candidates, but also civilians and criminals. Being willing to attack them in an attempt to see if they hold the potential to catch her eye, being extremely joyful if they hold promise and laughs at their potential strength when challenging her back. Though if they are lacking in a specific trait, she considers them a lost cause and loses interest through boredom. At the same time, if her expectations are shot when they show fear, she ruthlessly kills them with no regret - although this seems to extend primarily towards criminals she fights.",
      "As such, for those she does find an interest in, like the Rover, Camellya feels joyful and satisfied at the thought of someone she considers a worthy opponent. Ignoring personal space while at the same time observes from a distance, with Camellya admitting she can only trust the Rover and nobody else, including herself. Becoming joyful when she and the Rover discover that they're always fated to meet. However, this causes Camellya to hold great expectations towards them, where should she defeat the Rover, whom she sees as stronger than her, it produces a mental breakdown that she considers a nightmare until she's snapped out of it.",
      "Camellya also has a great displeasure towards those she deem weak, which includes herself whenever she falls ill to her Overclock symptoms. She is also confused by those such as the Shorekeeper or Jinhsi, who are constantly dedicated towards their duties, feeling they are burdening themselves over such complications. Finding responsibilities and ideals as a false high that are all lies, and that one should live in the present in order to live. With Camellya even describing her actions as nothing more but instincts as animals and plants posses. Even so, despite Camellya's dislike towards any form of responsibility, as all things die in the end, she holds respect towards the Shorekeeper who helped her many times in the past, thus continues her duties as a Bloom Bearer for the Black Shores.",
      "As Lady Flora, Camellya's past-self, she holds almost the exact same traits as her present-self including her interest in the Rover, considering them a friend, and shadowed them wherever they went. Though while Lady Flora may have similar traits as her present-day self, such as holding a disdain for the weak, and enjoying battle with those who hold promise, Lady Flora is described as being more sentimental by the present Camellya, as Lady Flora was hurt when the Rover decided to erase their memories of everything. Lady Flora also held an attachment to her adopted home, Petalfall Village. While she had seen them as weak crybabies, Lady Flora did her best to save the villagers when they were under threat as a favor for taking her in when she had lost all memories.  And despite claiming she didn't care for them after the event, different timeline junctures reveal that depending on the outcome of her former home's fate, Lady Flora's personality could have changed greatly.",
      "After the Rover left, realizing she would not get better from her Overclocking symptoms, Lady Flora declared that she'd rather die than becoming a helpless weakling, and feared the idea of gaining the Rover's affection and love from pity in such a state. As such, she chose to seal her own memory to stabilize her health, something her present-day self, Camellya, agrees with and claims that she won't bother searching for Lady Flora's memories unless they reappear naturally."

          "She awoke from her dream.The sun broke over the horizon, casting a warm glow across the Black Shores. It was the dawn of another ordinary day. Camellya opened her eyes, stretching leisurely atop the treetops. Her movements were graceful, and a fall would be unthinkable. Even if she did slip, the vines would cradle her fall. She loved sleeping like this, away from any disturbance or people.\"What a beautiful morning,\" she mused. She felt stable, in mind and body, and the thought of needing the medical pod seemed distant. This was a good thing.She knew Rover was to remain in the Black Shores, preparing for their journey to Rinascita. The prospect delighted her, for that meant more time to talk, laugh, and spend time together.She gave Rover a gift, a bracelet designed to monitor frequencies, just like the one they had given her before.It was the first gift she had ever prepared for someone.\"How peculiar!\" she mused. To wonder about someone's safety, or whether they even existed... it was truly a novel feeling! Surely, it meant that she cared about their life. Such thoughts were foreign—she had never cared about her own life, or that of others. But after leaving the Stellar Matrix with Rover and discovering her identity as Lady Flora, she had begun to see things in a subtle new light.Still, she had no intention of following Rover to Rinascita. Their views on certain aspects of Solaris' history differed, and just as she did not intend to meddle in their choices, she didn't feel the need to explain her own. In fact, to spare Rover from the added burden, she had kept some truths hidden from them. In the Stellar Matrix, she hadn't completely lost all memories of her past.Yes, her past… Camellya squinted, a soft hum escaping her lips as she contemplated her next move. She wanted to investigate further on her own, biding her time until the moment felt right to share what she knew with Rover. She had little faith in the organization built on this shore, and even less in the Tethys System. Aside from Rover, she had little trust in anyone else.Once, as Lady Flora, she had shied away from entanglements, unwilling to watch Rover sacrifice themselves for the greater good. But now her perspective had shifted. She saw little resemblance to the Lady Flora of her past.She had followed Rover's travels from Jinzhou till now.A singular force, always moving forward, gathering a diverse array of companions along the way.She understood that this was still not her path, yet she no longer resisted observing it. Just as one pebble meets another, sending ripples across the water's surface, she embraced the idea of being a \"variable\" in this dance. Now, the joy she derived from their connection was profound. She felt no trace of the usual boredom creeping in, nor did she wish to erase thoughts of them. Instead, her thoughts often drifted to them, yearning to learn more about their adventures and share more delightful games. It was then Camellya realized that these thoughts had already left painful yet pleasing marks on her soul, long before she ever noticed.Feeling suddenly inspired, she activated her Terminal and drafted a brief message to Rover, set to send just before their departure. The bracelet allowed her to check on them anytime, so there was nothing to worry about. Though Solaris was vast, she believed that if they were threads in the same story, their paths would surely cross again.At a time when Rover was none the wiser, that's when she would surprise them!As she envisioned this delightful moment, a melody escaped her lips. Vines twisted around her arms, climbing upwards, as tiny buds began to bloom at their tips.Suddenly, a thought struck her.\"I will give them a flower.\"As this idea took root in her mind, it consumed her completely. She had to find Rover—now! The flower, born from her very being, would neither wither nor decay unless she perished. She was stunned by her own eagerness and felt a flicker of sadness. As she reflected on it, a dull ache interrupted her thoughts.With a sigh, she chose not to dwell on it. For… Yes! A smile graced her lips as she resolved to keep that flower blooming for Rover. She would do her utmost not to die too soon.Camellya leaped from the treetops, joyfully headed toward Rover, her cherished seed of fate."

          "She awoke from her dream.The walls of the medical pod sank into darkness. Enveloped in heavy silence due to sound dampening, Camellya blinked and turned her dry gaze to the right. The indicators on the Terminal screen had returned to normal. The shackles around her wrists and ankles had loosened, yet she still felt weak, forcing her to remain lying in the narrow confines of the pod.She tried to recall what had happened. She forced a precarious composure trying to remember, but the lost memories felt like a bottomless black hole—gazing into it revealed only darkness. Her memories had fractured once again.Having been with the Black Shores for only a year, Camellya had recently passed the test to become an official Bloom Bearer. She now enjoyed greater access to the Tethys System's archives of information.Before her arrival there, she had wandered across Solaris for a long time.The cave where she first awoke showed no signs of other people, only twisted plants climbing the walls. Barefoot, Camellya waded through the water until she emerged into the open air, discovering a desolate village. Her foot struck something—a stone slab bearing the faded inscription, \"Petalfall Village.\"It took her a long time to escape that abandoned place. When hunger struck, she hunted wild beasts for sustenance. When thirst overtook her, she drank from mountain springs. It took her several months to traverse the dense forests and finally arrive at a place bustling with people. Only later did she realize that the village had likely been forgotten for hundreds of years.Even after returning to civilization, Camellya's memories remained blank, unstimulated by her new surroundings. She felt like an untamed animal, living on pure instinct. The rules and regulations of the human world were foreign to her, but she wasn't frustrated—using her Forte was enough. To her, power was an instinctive weapon, and she wielded it freely, carving her own path through the Lament-scarred land.Initially, everything in Solaris fascinated her. However, as she gradually learned more, boredom set in quickly. Arriving at the Black Shores had been an accident, yet Camellya felt a strange familiarity with it. A year later, she found her name in the Tethys System and learned that she had once lived and worked there, known then as Lady Flora. It was odd how she had forgotten everything yet still remembered the name \"Camellya.\"Driven by curiosity, she began her investigation of the Black Shores, eager to uncover her past and the stories of Lady Flora. What had truly happened to her?As those thoughts surfaced, a sharp pain pierced her head again, and the flower in her chest suddenly swelled, darkening to a deep purple. The sharp thorns of its veins threatened to tear through the medical pod. Fragments of memories flickered in her mind—Ah, Lady Flora had forbidden her from recalling the past. Camellya let out a muffled scream of pain as the restraints tightened once again around her limbs, and a loud alarm blared. Medical personnel would arrive soon.Yet, she knew there was little they could do. They had already examined her carefully, concluding that her Overclocking symptoms were unique and untreatable, manageable only through restraint. Death could offer relief, but in her current condition, she couldn't even simply die.All she could do was wait, wait for the grace of death. This passivity chafed at her spirit. If she couldn't decide the outcome, she at least wanted to control the process.\"I'll follow my instincts until death finds me.\"\"It hurts!\" she thought.Despite her agony, Camellya laughed loudly."

          "She awoke from her dream.Lady Flora opened her eyes, feeling the cold air brushing against her fingertips, making her hands and feet slightly numb. She dawdled in her seat for a moment, slowly sitting up to take in her surroundings.The vehicle had come to a halt in a cave, a refuge from the snowstorm outside, where an endless silver expanse of snow stretched before her. Frost flowers drifted gently from the sky, landing delicately on the tip of her nose. Shivering, she huddled deeper into her thick clothing.She was not the kind of plant that could withstand the cold.\"Where did the leader go?\" she asked after taking a few sips of water, turning to the Bloom Bearer in the front seat. \"I didn't see them.\"\"The leader? They went west. They said something interesting had turned up and wanted to take a look.\"\"Why didn't they take me? I am their guard, after all!\" she complained under her breath.Her fellow Bloom Bearer chuckled as he drove, barely glancing away from the steaming soup. \"You were asleep! You haven't been sleeping well on the journey, always shivering in the cold. They didn't want to wake you while you finally caught some rest.\"Grumbling quietly under her breath, Lady Flora pouted and swung the door open. \"Anyway, I'm off to find them now!\"The Bloom Bearer waved her off, clearly used to the dynamic between Lady Flora and their leader.Leaving the warmth of the vehicle, Lady Flora dragged her feet across the snowy expanse, memories of their first encounter in Petalfall Village flooding back. She had known they would come to this snowy plain for the mission, and despite her dislike of the cold, she knew the time spent with the leader of the Black Shores would be worth it. Most of the time, she opted to accompany Rover on various errands, leaving her footprints across the tapestry of Solaris, from bustling towns to unknown alcoves, safe havens to treacherous lands. Lady Flora relished this existence, brimming with the thrill of the unknown, and Rover had an uncanny talent for transforming the ordinary into something extraordinary.She didn't mind the threat of danger. In fact, she rather enjoyed it. To her, danger signified change, and change led to excitement. She did find, however, that with her leader by her side, she stifled her impulse to seek out trouble for fun.Danger...Camellya raised her hand, the delicate chain on her wrist catching the light. The bracelet monitoring her Rabelle indicators read as normal. She squeezed her wrist and exhaled softly. \"Good, everything is as it should be,\" she thought. \"If I start spiraling out of control, they would have to look after me. It would derail the entire mission.\"She hated losing control.In recent years, Lady Flora had been haunted by bizarre and fragmented dreams. They felt like memories of a life she had never lived. In these dreams, she was always searching for Rover, but the two never found each other. Each time she jolted awake, a disquiet settled over her, the mental turmoil seeping into her very being. She was often forced to report to the Black Shores medical facility.The thought soured her mood.She needed to find them as quickly as possible.Shoving those tangled thoughts aside, she focused on pinpointing Rover's frequencies. After crossing two hills and a frozen lake, she finally spotted a blurry figure in the distance.\"Camellya, how did you sleep?\"Their golden eyes sparkled with warmth, and she couldn't help but smile back.\"Hehe… With my leader by my side, of course I had the sweetest dreams,\" she heard herself reply."

          "She awoke from her dream.The interval between unconsciousness and consciousness became shorter with each passing day. Lady Flora was starting to find it hard to tell where her dreams ended and reality began. She couldn't even recall when this disorientation had started.Memories surged like turbulent waves, crashing into her mind and wreaking havoc on her senses. Pain ripped through her body, relentlessly and unforgivingly. She opened her mouth to scream, but Overclocking had turned her throat into a gnarled, coarse root, silencing her cries.After struggling to take just a few faltering steps, she collapsed onto a muddy riverbank, trembling, her fingertips spasming uncontrollably.How many times had this happened? She stared blankly at the dark night sky above.A void of chaos swirled within her, yet there was one thing that stood out in sharp relief: {PlayerName}.She remembered everything now.Who she was, who {PlayerName} is, the reason for her being, Solaris, and the Lament…Before the madness of Overclocking engulfed her, those memories were always buried deep, locked in the depths of her being. Each time she awoke, she lost all recollection, left only with an aching void. As time passed and her body weakened under the strain of Overclocking, glimpses of her mission and roots would resurface, only to vanish again in an endless cycle.How many times had it happened? Lady Flora had no answer.Civilizations crumbled into dust, only to rise anew; life faded, only to blossom once more.She was witness to the ebb and flow of Solaris, yet remained forever a wanderer in her own mind.\"{PlayerName}…\" The name slipped from her lips like a prayer.They had never truly met or exchanged words, and now, with her memories fading, she couldn't even tell if they were friends or foes. Yet somehow, the next time she awoke she knew her instincts would lead her to seek them out. It was not a tender yearning. It felt more like the weight of a heavy chain, one Lady Flora could not resist.Yet she felt no hatred for this chain.The rustle of leaves shattered her reverie. Wearily, she blinked, and the red camellia unfurled, its vines piercing through the Tacet Discords lurking in the shadows. Yes, this was her instinct, her essence, the core of her being... Even as she teetered on the edge of forgetting everything, she could always rely on her instincts.In truth, beyond her instincts, there was nothing left for her to hold onto.\"Next time, if only I could truly get to know {PlayerName} and share a conversation with them.\"Lady Flora mused hazily. Perhaps the Tethys System would lead {PlayerName} to her since she had already revealed herself in this mission.Lady Flora closed her eyes and surrendered to the darkness as the pain peaked.The lake's cool water swelled across her cheek, the camellia withering as its vines retreated into her body.The autumn night breeze blew through the leaves, caressing her as she lay by the lake. To the north, the villagers of Petalfall Village would soon awaken from their dreams, calling to one another as they prepared to set out on a new day of fishing."

          "She awoke from her dream.The wind howled fiercely at the rooftop's edge as she stretched, squinting down at the lively streets below. Vehicles crisscrossed the roads, their taillights forming a vibrant, fiery chain. Resting her chin on her hand, she began to hum.It was a song she had learned from Rover.Of course, she hadn't heard it directly from Rover, she had picked it up secretly.They might not be enemies, but their relationship was far from friendly—at best, it was a one-sided acquaintance. Rover's presence had caught the eye of various factions, including her own organization. Yet, that hardly concerned her, nor was it something she could afford to contemplate.She was merely a \"chosen seed,\" a \"flower\" that bloomed for the sole purpose of hunting Rover down. Most days, the injections left her in a fog, drifting through a semi-conscious haze, with only her instinctual yearning for a certain person carved deep into her heart.The substance she was administered had a sharp, acrid scent, dragging her reason into a mire, robbing her of clarity and self.Her thoughts whirled chaotically, like a bomb on the brink of detonation, forced to reset just before the countdown expired.But she didn't care.Outside of Rover, little else piqued her interest. Sometimes, they felt like a mere silhouette against a blank canvas, an outline of a stranger. The portrait was drawn from fragments of information she had painstakingly gathered—they were so close yet had never truly met. She didn't know what they looked like.It was said this distance was necessary to evade the Tethys System's tracking. Contact was forbidden.But how she longed to meet Rover!Perched dangerously on the edge of the building, she laughed at the fantasy. Vines entwined around her arms, climbing higher, their delicate buds slowly unfurling at their tips.Suddenly, a thought struck her.\"I'll give them a flower.\"The moment the thought emerged, it consumed her entirely. She envisioned the moment she would find Rover and present this gift—a blossom sprouted from her very being. It would neither wither nor decay unless she perished. But just as quickly as it came, the thought vanished into the chaos of her mind, leaving no trace behind.Little did she know, centuries later, the scene before her would vanish in the Lament. She would wander endlessly through a labyrinth of memories until one autumn morning, by a lake in Petalfall Village, where she would finally meet Rover, there to rescue the village from Tacet Discord attacks. From there, she would join the Black Shores and share a few hundred years together before they would eventually leave her. She, too, would leave the Black Shores, only to be reunited decades later in Jinzhou. All those futures had yet to unfold, just as possibilities slumbered within seeds, waiting for fate to blossom.She leaped from the building, her vines weaving through the city's structures, searching for them."

          "Outside an old house in Yuezhou lies a patch of reeds beside a lake. To the north, the water narrows; to the south, it widens, resembling a sliced pear, with the surface shimmering under the night sky.The summer air hung thick with heat, lulling the world into a drowsy stupor.In the quiet of the evening, Lumi nestled in her mother's arms on a rocking chair by the window. Her eyelids drooped as she gazed out sleepily. The soft breeze from a fan brushed her skin, making her squint with contentment. The chorus of insects filled the yard, and Lumi curled even closer to her mother, lulled by the comforting sounds of the village.This small place was Changzhuang. No one could quite remember why it was called that, but they grew accustomed to this name over time.The disasters following the Lament had spread across all of Huanglong. Even here, deep in the mountains of Yuezhou, they had left their indelible mark by cutting the village off from the outside world—technology crumbled, and the villagers returned to the old ways—farming, hunting, surviving as their ancestors once had. Life was dictated by the rising and setting sun. Over time, people in Changzhuang became used to the peace and simplicity of this lifestyle.The day Lumi was born, the whole house lit up. The swaddled infant glowed softly, catching the eye of every villager. They gathered in the yard, curious to see the newborn who shone like a small beacon. Resonators were rare here, and ones like Lumi, with such innate power, were even rarer. But in a village as tranquil as Changzhuang, there were no grand challenges that even needed a child Resonator to solve. Therefore, Lumi grew up carefree, just like other ordinary children in the village. She learned the ways of the mountains and fields—how to track wild animal traces and how to distinguish which plants might sate a hungry belly.People in Changzhuang enjoyed cooling off under the shade of a tree. As Lumi ran through the trees with her friends, her inborn light flickered as if performing a cheerful dance. The village elders lovingly called her \"Sunshine,\" while her friends dubbed her \"Lumi the Firefly.\" Yet Lumi often wondered about her strange gift, unsure of its purpose. More often than not, it was a nuisance. On hunting trips, her light would flash uncontrollably, startling prey.After being asked to temporarily sit out from the hunts, Lumi's heart sank with a pang of frustration. Alone, she wandered to the marshes by the reeds and sat down. Her glow flickered, dimmed, and then brightened again as she practiced, trying to control the light. Finally, exhaustion set in, and she drifted off to sleep. Despite her struggles, Lumi never felt rushed.Life in Changzhuang was slow, and there was always time to grow and to learn.The shimmering surface of the lake returned to darkness. The night breeze ferried the croaks of frogs away. Tomorrow was another day."

          "\"Tuesday, clear skies. I watched the sunset from Caidong Peak! But Zhangzhang didn't come… She seems to have lost interest in this kind of thing...\"Lumi paused and closed her notebook in the golden light of the setting sun.It was a thick hardcover notebook—a birthday gift from her parents, one she had chosen herself. Once a diary, it had transformed into an exploration journal as she grew older. As a child, Lumi was content wandering the pebble paths of Changzhuang, but now, those paths felt too small. Her curiosity stretched beyond the borders of the village. She longed for the roads that led to the world outside.The only problem was—no one had found those roads in a long, long time.Her father once told her about the many failed attempts. Over the years, many had tried to find a way beyond the mountains, but all had returned empty-handed, lost, or worse. Eventually, the villagers gave up, their focus shifting to more immediate concerns. Life in Changzhuang was demanding—farming from spring to autumn, then bracing for the long winter when the mountains would disappear under a blanket of silver frost, making exploration impossible.Lumi understood the demands of life, yet her curiosity and yearning for adventure burned even brighter. She quickly gathered a group of friends and formed a small exploration team, determined to find a way out. But despite their excitement, failure kicked in—the aftermath of the Lament had seemingly twisted the terrain, eliminating every possible way out, just like it had their forebears.At first, the setbacks didn't bother them. They were kids, after all, full of energy and hope. But as time passed, they drifted away. The older ones joined the labor teams, others lost interest. Lumi's once lively group dwindled, and today, her exploration ended earlier than planned as everyone was eager to hurry home before dusk settled in.Lumi sighed.She knew that for most of her friends, this was just a way to pass the time.She stood up, cupped her hands around her mouth, and shouted toward the mountains, her voice echoing against the rocks and trees before fading into the evening air.The sunset blazed across the sky, casting the horizon in shades of red and gold before melting into the soft kiss of the night.Lumi smiled, patting her cheeks lightly. It didn't matter. The thrill of discovering something new, something unknown, still filled her with excitement.\"…Oh! I'll tell Zhangzhang all about the view when we meet for ice pops tonight. And Beihai, Ming…\"She whispered the names of her friends as she waved goodbye to the mountains, then turned and made her way down the hill, alone but content."

          "\"You're awake? Here, drink this.\"As her eyes fluttered open, her parched lips met the cool, sweet droplets of water. Her hand instinctively gripped the container, and she eagerly gulped it down.\"Easy now, don't rush,\" the voice urged, gentle and concerned. \"You'll choke if you drink too fast.\"As the last drop slipped down her throat, Lumi blinked, her mind finally clearing. She looked up at the faces of her rescuers—a small squad, three of them, dressed in similar clothing. Their leader, a girl with a kind smile, helped her sit up.\"Are you from around here? That's a surprise. We were told there's no one living in these parts,\" the girl said, a hint of curiosity in her voice. \"Guess we'll need to update our map.\"\"Thank you… for saving me,\" Lumi whispered, her words faltering. The world she knew was small, confined to the mountains and the narrow boundaries of Changzhuang. \"A-are you from the outside?\"The squad exchanged glances, and it was then that Lumi noticed the emblem on their uniforms—a chubby hamster wearing a straw hat, grinning adorably.A hand reached out, helping Lumi to her feet.\"Sorry for the late introduction. We're from Lollo Logistics, a delivery squad.\"Months later, Chengxiao smiled, setting down the comb and patting Lumi's shoulder.\"Take a look. How do you feel?\"Lumi stared at her reflection, stunned by the unfamiliar face in the mirror. The girl staring back at her had neat curls and wore a clean, fitted Lollo Logistics uniform—looking every bit the city dweller she had become.Chengxiao, the leader of the squad that had rescued her, had taken Lumi from the quiet of Changzhuang to the bustling city and taken her under her wing. She was quick-witted, reliable, and now Lumi's mentor at Lollo Logistics.\"I look… different,\" Lumi muttered, scratching her head shyly. \"Thank you, Chengxiao.\"\"None of that formality now,\" Chengxiao laughed. \"I'm off to deliver some documents. Cafeteria later?\"\"Sure!\"As the door closed, Lumi returned to stare at the mirror, her gaze lingering on her reflection for a while.Having just passed the Lollo Logistics assessment, she was still adjusting to city life. The city was a whirlwind compared to the quiet village she had left behind. The streets buzzed with life, day and night. Even in the dead of night, lights flickered, and voices filled the air. Walls and doors were everywhere, and restrictions at every corner. In Changzhuang, she could run free, straight through the open land for as long as she wanted. Here, every step had to be measured carefully. The crowded markets left her both energized and overwhelmed.\"Take it slow, Lumi,\" she murmured to herself. \"No rush. No rush…\"Grabbing her straw hat, Lumi took a deep breath and opened the door, ready to face the city once more."

          "\"Squeakie, I'm feeling dizzy…\"Lumi murmured, leaning against the edge of the bed as the ship rocked beneath her. The waves crashed against the hull with a roar, and the violent turbulence made one feel like it might drag them into the depths. She clutched her hamster plushie tightly, closing her eyes, waiting for this tortuous journey to end.Days later, the port finally came into view, where the sea met the sky. Seagulls squawked in the distance, and Lumi exhaled a breath of relief as she stepped onto solid ground. \"Thank goodness,\" she muttered. Her two companions, Tangtang and Fulei, staggered behind her, still pale from seasickness.\"You two okay?\" Lumi ran her fingers through her curls and led them to a nearby bench for rest.\"Lumi, was it this bad when you first came to Rinascita?\" Tangtang, his head still drooping, asked.Lumi chuckled. \"Oh yeah! That's why I told you to stay fit. There are places way harder to reach than this.\"Tangtang groaned, nodding. \"Why did you recover so quickly? You were just as seasick as us a moment ago...\"Lumi grinned, remembering her first trip here with Chengxiao. \"Trust me, I was just as bad. My legs felt weak, I wanted to throw up, and I almost swore never to set foot on a ship again!\"Fulei nodded in agreement, \"The ship did rock hard. It was terrifying…\"Tangtang and Fulei were newbies who just joined Lollo Logistics and were assigned to Lumi's team for training. Lollo Logistics had entrusted her with guiding them through the ropes, but leading a team? Lumi wasn't so sure she was ready for that kind of responsibility. It wasn't because she hated caring for others; she was just worried that she might not meet these hopeful newcomers' expectations. Chengxiao had always made it look easy—could she really do the same?\"Lumi,\" Tangtang said, interrupting her thoughts, \"You always talk about Chengxiao, but I've never seen her at the branch. Where is she?\"\"She doesn't work in the field anymore,\" Lumi replied softly.\"What? But didn't you say she was an 'Outstanding Navigator' every year? Why would she quit?\" Fulei asked, wide-eyed.Lumi gazed up at the blue sky, the expanse above Ragunna remarkably clear.\"Because... of life,\" she explained, as she had once before in her childhood. \"Sometimes life leads you down different paths. Solaris is huge, and being in Lollo Logistics means traveling year-round. Chengxiao wanted something more stable, so she moved on.\"Tangtang tilted her head. \"And what about you? Did your family mind you doing this?\"\"They had their concerns,\" Lumi admitted. \"But this is my life, and I love it—traveling, seeing new things, connecting people across Solaris. That's what Lollo Logistics is all about. Chengxiao taught me a lot, and I'll do my best to pass it on to you both.\"Her words hung in the air as the two newcomers considered them.Lumi smiled. \"Life is full of comings and goings,\" she continued. \"Some people get off the ship, others get on. But as long as there are those willing to carry the torch, our 'We Promise, We Deliver' motto will keep going strong.\"Lumi stood up and gave a good stretch, Squeakie perched on her shoulder, nuzzling her cheek. \"Rest for another ten minutes, then we're off. Oh, you want some famous Ragunna's triple scoop ice cream? My treat!\"\"Yes!\"\"Please!\""

          "Ever since its connection to the outside world resumed, Changzhuang had experienced a dramatic change. New buildings and amenities were everywhere, yet when Lumi returned home, she felt a deep wave of nostalgia.Perhaps those who longed for change had already departed, like Lumi once before, while those who remained had maintained their old habits and daily rhythms. The sun was dipping low, and as she walked through the village, smoke from cooking fires curled lazily into the sky, mingling with the sounds of laughter and the hum of evening insects.Her parents welcomed her home, placing a steaming bowl of noodles in front of her—the meat was generous, the broth rich, supplemented by a spoonful of fragrant chili oil.Lumi dug in, the heat making her cheeks flush as she slurped the noodles eagerly. Her mother chuckled softly, passing her a glass of water.\"Slow down, Lumi, no one's going to steal your food,\" her mother teased.After a deep sip of water and broth, she leaned back, letting out a contented sigh.Her father, seated nearby, tapped his pipe. \"Been away for a long time, huh? How's your work?\"Lumi smiled. \"It's been tough, but things are getting better. Someone really helped me out—a hero from Jinzhou, actually!\"Her mother raised an eyebrow, amused. \"Oh? Our little Lumi rubbing elbows with big shots now?\"Lumi laughed, her eyes bright. \"It's true! I was struggling with some work stuff, but thanks to them, I turned it all around. Here's what happened…\"The next morning, with the village still shrouded in the quiet calm of dawn, Lumi left home to enjoy the morning landscape of the fields. It hadn't changed beyond recognition. It still bore the vestiges of the place that had shaped her.She wandered without aim, lost in thought until a gentle pat on the shoulder brought her back to the present.\"Lumi? What are you doing all the way out here?\"Lumi blinked and turned to see Zhangzhang, her childhood friend, standing behind her, smiling.\"Oh, Zhangzhang! I was just… reminiscing. It's been a while.\" Lumi's gaze drifted to the newly paved road winding through the hills. \"I can't even tell where we are.\"Zhangzhang laughed. \"Yeah, it just got finished recently—much smoother than before, huh? It was once your favorite place, you remember?\" She shifted her gaze to the road and continued, \"Not many people come through, though. But I hear your Lollo Logistics team visits regularly.\" Zhangzhang paused, intrigued, \"Speaking of which, have you been to any cool places lately? Anything to share? You see, I've been thinking about leaving to see the world for myself as well…\"Lumi nodded and began recounting her latest adventures, sharing the tales of distant cities and unknown lands with her childhood friend.When they parted ways, Lumi found a stone by the road and sat on it, propping her chin up as she gazed at the sky. She knew that she had to move forward—only then would she see new things, bring about change, and make a difference for others.As night faded, the first light of morning washed over the slumbering mountains.There in the distance, where the mountain path met the sky, the familiar silhouette of a Lollo Logistics vehicle, glimmering in the sun, was approaching Changzhuang."

      "Carlotta is a young woman who has long, flowing silver-white hair that cascades past her shoulders. Her eyes are a vibrant mix of pink and teal. Carlotta wears  a striking and elaborate outfit that blends elegance with a touch of edge. She wears a short, white, sleeveless dress with a high neckline, embellished with lace and delicate patterns, creating a soft, flowing silhouette. Over this, she has a vibrant, magenta-colored cape with intricate designs, trimmed with blue on the inside, and it flows behind her, adding drama to her appearance. The outfit is accentuated with a fitted black corset-style bodice that enhances her figure and introduces a gothic flair. Her legs are clad in thigh-high black boots with bold pink stockings, that feature blue and magenta details, combining femininity with a hint of toughness and underneath her dress is a short black shorts. She accessorizes with black gloves, ornate jewelry, and a magenta head band with ribbons adorned on it."

          "The night rain drummed the window and stirred up an odor of pungent liquor. Carlotta didn't like the smell, but she took comfort in that only those compelled by the strongest of desires would venture out in such weather, and such individuals were rarely subtle.",
          "A woman in worn yet carefully maintained clothing tried to appear nonchalant, but her eyes were fixated on the auctioneer's every move like a desperate gambler. A flamboyant man in the central foyer loudly expounded upon various art styles, unwilling to relinquish the attention he had attracted, all the while unaware that he had conflated several distinct schools of art. Finally, a boy lurked by a window, furtively glancing at Carlotta before catching himself and looking away—rather tactless, but by no means a problem.",
          "For Carlotta, this was a game whose outcome was hers to decide.",
          "This was not Carlotta's first auction. On stage under a soft spotlight, the pieces came and went. Potential buyers murmured among themselves, forgoing discussions of artistic merit in favor of analyzing each work's price history. Creating art is a noble endeavor, but the business of art is far less so. Here each transaction was a present wager on a future payoff.",
          "Even so, Carlotta still raised her placard for niche works that held little mainstream appeal. To her, these pieces were part of a grand strategy—whether a meaningless melange of shapes or a deconstructive expression of true artistry... time would reveal the answer, with returns far exceeding expectations.",
          "Such behavior was initially met with skepticism, but Carlotta's air of certainty soon began to sway the bidders and shape their choices. It seemed as though she had a strategy uniquely grounded in art theory, aesthetic sensibility, and market insight. Yet she was about to go one step further in search of greater heights.",
          "And then, the moment arrived, right then and there...",
          "In the final seconds of bidding, Carlotta raised her placard once more to the astonishment of onlookers. Seeing this, the flamboyant man instantly one-upped her bid.",
          "Countdown. Bid. Countdown. Bid... The auction rushed forward, each bid thicker and faster than the last, pushing everyone's emotions toward a suffocating crescendo. The woman in worn clothing widened her eyes in disbelief at the rising sums. The boy scarcely caught his breath as he whipped his head back and forth at the frenzy of activity.",
          "Just as the auctioneer's hammer was about to fall, Carlotta waved at her rival with a rueful smile. \"How unexpected that there is another who recognizes the true worth of this painting. Your willingness to stake such a sum... It rightfully belongs to you.\"",
          "The event drew to a close, but Carlotta still had a few matters to settle.",
          "She watched the man leave with the painting before retreating into a quiet corner. The boy who had locked eyes with her earlier approached.",
          "\"I let slip that Carlotta Montelli had her eyes set on a masterpiece. Just like you instructed, Miss.\"",
          "Carlotta smiled and gave the boy his reward. If he stayed agreeable, she wouldn't mind taking him into her confidence again, should she need him again for some future trivial task. As for the woman lingering nearby...",
          "\"Miss Carlotta, I'm very grateful for all that you've done for me and my father. It's just... it's just...\" The woman hesitated, searching for the right words. Carlotta didn't miss a beat.",

Carlotta lifted her eyes to glimpse blurred shadows through the faint light piercing sheets of water. Wasn't she another shadow in the downpour? Yes... A shadow that reaped lives to right past wrongs.",

She had traveled across Ragunna to find the man standing before her, nearly forgotten by time. Her words were terse, \"To be frank, I've come in the name of the Montellis to read you your obituary.\"",

          "A window in the room was ajar, and a cold breeze crept in, bringing the chill of the night. The old man shivered, but his frailty only irritated Carlotta. He spoke as though he hadn't once schemed against the Montellis and ingratiated himself with the Fisalias. As if he hadn't orchestrated the Montelli headquarters raid which cost so many their lives, even after the family had agreed to a deal over the West End.",
          "Carlotta's retort was sharp.",
          "\"You knew the consequences of your actions.\"",
          "\"Bah! You Montellis never change. It's been ten years. Everything's over. You took back the West End, while I've been cowering like a rat in a hole. I live in fear that come any rain-sodden night, someone like you might sneak in and end my life.\"",
          "The old man sighed, his expression hardening. His hand shot out for a hidden weapon.",
          "Carlotta said nothing. Her crystal morphed into a gun in a silent but lethal threat.",
          "For Carlotta, this was not about revenge, this was about unpaid debts and lost respect. Any Montelli could die, but as long as one Montelli remained, the family would not fall. A Montelli's absolute trust in their kin gave them the peace of mind to lay down their lives for the good of the family. Should they fall, another would take up their mantle and finish what had to be done. So, even after ten years, this debt had to be settled. Only then would it truly be over. It was never a question of money and closure but of loyalty and commitment.",
          "Bang! Another \"gem\" shattered into shards.",
          "The old man slumped to the floor. He looked up, determined to keep Carlotta in sight, but he could no longer move.",

          "Yes. It was a game that only ended once spent.",

No matter, Carlotta bit down on her glove and tore it off her hand. She had to continue this deadly dance with her life on the line.",
          "Earlier that night... the most opulent ballroom at City Hall played host to a gathering attended by the Order, the Fisalias, and the Montellis, all powerful forces with their own agendas. Carlotta was no different. She had chosen a dress and heels that offered her freedom of movement. She would melt into the crowd and wait in the shadows.",

          "\"The Order holds the reins of this city. We Fisalias will not allow you to disrupt the delicate balance. The Montelli vision is too radical.\"",
          "\"You call us radical, and yet it is you who hungers for power. You seek to control the tide, as if it could ever be held still.\"",
          "Their duet grew increasingly frenetic as both sought to seize the upper hand. It became a dance of delicate evasion, brief moments of contact before pulling apart in the same fluid motion. As the music reached its climax, the woman drew back, glancing at the crowd, her gaze searching for the other hidden Montellis.",
          "Carlotta gripped the woman's hand, guiding her back into their rhythmic dance. The music kept them bound together. The woman had no escape, and she dared not make a scene. All she could do was glare at Carlotta with malice.",
          "\"The Montellis have ears everywhere. From the start, you were after my \"children.\" I hope you're prepared to dance until death do us part.\"",
          "Their dance suddenly took on a new meaning. Carlotta halted, spun, struck, and the targets fell... Her tango became a single, deadly waltz with the woman's guards and \"children\" all the way to here, their struggle punctuated by the relentless rain.",
          "Carlotta felt poison seep into her wound, its mind-bending venom ravaging her veins. Something metallic trickled from the corner of her mouth. Carlotta smirked, letting out a soft, bitter laugh.",
          "Was this the fate of that woman's last dance partner? No matter. Sooner or later, all who deal in death meet its embrace.",

          "Carlotta shifted her skirts and looked into the mirror. The wound had healed nicely and the scar was no longer visible. The toxins had also been completely purged. But she wasn't keen on resting. She kept it to herself, but doing nothing made her uneasy as if something was slipping through her fingers. Carlotta decided to consult Grandfather on how best to handle the recent \"troubles.\"",
          "She found him in a corridor by the foyer. A late sleeper like herself, it was not unusual for Grandfather to be up at this hour. She could not tell whether he was watching the rain outside or admiring the painting on the wall, or perhaps...",
          "\"Grandfather, are you waiting for me?\"",
          "\"Not exactly. You see, I was thinking about you when you first joined the family.\"",
          "His response caught Carlotta off guard. Truth be told, she didn't like the person she was back then: naïve, weak, abandoned, far removed from being a Montelli. There was so much she had to learn—about Ragunna, the Montellis, and problems that required elegant solutions. Almost no one believed in her except Grandfather. Back then the only thing she took pride in was her Forte, which she instinctively wielded as a means to an end. Over time, she had adapted to the Montelli Code, using her abilities to handle the family's more delicate matters.",
          "Had something gone wrong in the process?",
          "Carlotta believed that her current role in the Montelli hierarchy was most beneficial to the family. They had accepted her, approved of her, and now, they needed her. She was a true granddaughter to the Padrino, more deserving of the Montelli name than ever before. So why was Grandfather bringing up the past?",
          "\"Do you remember? When you asked me to make you my Executor, I gave you those opal gloves right here, in this very spot,\" Grandfather gently patted Carlotta's shoulder. \"I have never doubted your abilities, but I've begun to wonder if that was truly what you wanted.\"",
          "What she truly wanted and what she was doing now... Carlotta saw little difference between the two. Life stretched on and through it, people needed certain beliefs, ideals, or loved ones to be their anchor. For Carlotta being a Montelli was her anchor—and the Montelli family was her everything.",
          "\"No, that's where you're mistaken,\" Grandfather said softly as if seeing exactly what Carlotta was thinking, \"A true Montelli does not live solely for the family. She does not exist to only follow rules, whether set by myself or by the family. She must feel the world and make her own rules.\"",
          "\"I want to see you shine because I believe you possess brilliance from within. Before you constrained yourself to the idea of what it meant to be a Montelli, you had just begun to define your own rules.\"",
          "The sky outside began to lighten... In the end, Grandfather declined to let Carlotta keep the role of Executor. Instead, he asked her to write a letter inviting representatives from the Black Shores to Ragunna. Carlotta looked out the window. After the rain, Ragunna was enveloped in a dull gray mist. The city was a slumbering beast, waiting for the grand arrival of the Carnevale to awaken it.",
          "At that moment, Carlotta was unaware that it was during this rainy night that Francesco Montelli made a decision that would shape the future of the Montellis. He would employ special means to return the power of choice to her hands. And she, like her original self, would pave the way for what was to come."

The tide rolls in and out, its golden ripples mirroring the endless cycle of Ragunna's days and nights. With no particular destination in mind, she wandered, pausing at random. This isn't her norm, but in the future, she might just make a habit of it, much like she has started making a habit of searching for parts of herself that belonged to Carlotta alone, separate from the Montellis.",

          "Naturally, as a Montelli, she could not afford to think only of herself. She was drawn to extremes, to reckless solutions, unafraid of change or risk. But when it came time to act, when decisions had to be made, she tempered those inclinations. In a way, this was indeed a constraint imposed by her identity—a collar forged by blood and duty. But it was also a bond that anchored her.",

Indeed, she still preferred to call them Cat's Eye. They had walked shoulder to shoulder for a time, but in the end, neither of them could have paused their journey for the other. They (Rover) had been blunt about her \"excessive perfection,\" and so, in keeping with the promise she made to \"be less reserved,\" Carlotta will weave that Cat's Eye into the fabric of her story. She can't shake the feeling that fate is not done with them yet. As for when, or how, or what new adventures may unfold between them... she can scarcely wait.",

          "Battier, the Fool's Troupe's best fisherman, ran into trouble one day on what was supposed to be an ordinary fishing trip. With only his trusted harpoon, he fought against an aquatic Tacet Discord so ferocious that it soon dragged him beneath the waves. Luckily, Roccia sensed something was off when Battier didn't return as expected and quickly rallied troupe members to form a small rescue team. They searched the nearby waters and finally pulled a drenched, beleaguered Battier ashore. However, his well-worn harpoon hadn't fared as well—it was wedged tight in the Tacet Discord's side, and both were swallowed by a whirlpool in the sea.Without his harpoon, Battier felt like he'd lost part of his spirit. He'd spend hours baiting traps and coming up empty, as if the fish sensed his missing piece, too. Some days, he'd just lie in the black sand of the Strand, staring at the dim sky. Even the clouds seemed to taunt him, shaping themselves into fish that drifted further and further away.\"Aaaaah—!\" he shouted at the sky in helpless frustration.As if to ease his mind, the clouds began to part, layer by layer, and beams of light spilled down, turning the sky into a shimmering sea. Right in the center, his lost harpoon appeared, descending like a divine gift from the heavens, gleaming in golden sunlight. It landed straight into his hand as if it had never left. In the meantime, fish swarmed to him once more, dancing through the air and across the water.Heartened by this wonder, Battier hauled in a full net to bring back to the troupe. Roccia and Pero used the catch to whip up a feast—roasted squid, creamy clam chowder, peppered fish steaks, and so on. The air was filled with the rich aroma of seafood as everyone gathered by the fire, laughing and eating together. Someone even wielded a fish skewer as a sword, putting on a little show that had people in stitches. Looking at the jolly crowd, Battier felt a warm feeling inside—it's the simple joy of being needed and the thrill of fishing for those who truly appreciated him.While the others were enjoying the feast, Roccia exchanged a quick smile with Pero before hiding the Cloudcaster they'd used earlier into a haystack. As a prop master, she knew how much meaning certain objects held for people. No matter how difficult, she'd always find a way to retrieve what was lost—whether from the sea or the sky. After giving them a good polish, she'd plan a heartwarming, dramatic reunion, just as she'd done with Battier's golden harpoon.From that day on, the troupe had a new show: Battier and the Golden Harpoon. The crew enjoyed re-enacting this enchanting story with grilled fish in hand and hearts full of laughter."

          "To become the troupe's first mate, one must prove they can face down any storm the sea can throw at them. That's why every first mate must pass a trial—a perilous voyage led by the troupe's best helmsperson. For Roccia, her helmsperson was none other than Tina.Even with young Roccia onboard, Tina held firm, steering the ship straight into the heart of a brewing storm with steady hands, unflinching as she faced the dark, roiling waves.Roccia didn't seem fazed at first. She calmly pulled out one of Pero's scripts, reading as if she were back under the troupe's tent instead of on a ship pitching wildly in the storm. She dabbed seawater from her face, reading plays prepared by Pero as though it were all a practiced routine. Years of crafting props and performing on stage had made her adaptable, and her time with Pero had taught her to understand and respond to the subtle frequencies of the Echo ship.But as they reached the depths of the storm, faint, glowing eyes began to surface in the dark waters, and ominous whispers carried on the wind. Roccia's steady demeanor seemed to falter—her hand wavered as she tucked the script away and gripped the edge of the cabin. Eventually, even the hardened Tina noticed Roccia's trembling. At a loss on how to comfort her, Tina instead raised her voice in song, her voice strong and steady, resonating with the Echo ship. All she could do in this situation was to hold the ship steady through the rough waters, which required absolute focus.Then, a softer voice joined her. Tina looked back to see Roccia huddled near the cabin, singing along with a light quaver to her voice. Though fear glinted in her eyes, Roccia hadn't forgotten her duty. She took out her telescope, scanning the dark horizon for their course. Tina's voice rose stronger, blending with Roccia's softer notes, overpowering the ominous whispers around them. Catching the right current, the ship surged forward, breaking through the storm into the first light of dawn.Back on shore, Roccia's face was as calm and collected as ever. From that day on, First Mate Roccia guided every voyage with a steady hand, always bringing people safely home.\"Roccia?\" Tina, known for her blunt honesty, was asked later. She grinned, a glint of pride in her eyes. \"She's tough and dependable—a good girl who deserves love and care. As for her pitch… well, let's just say it may not be perfect, but it's got heart.\""

          "Besides the twinkling star, little Luca's most cherished item is an old ticket.Luca remembers the day Roccia handed it to her after she'd been rescued from the Strand. Roccia was calm and steady, even though she couldn't have been much older than Luca herself. She could handle anything—helping lost pilgrims who drifted ashore, cooking meals for the troupe, recording funny moments, collecting seashells and Luceanites, even refilling the confetti pistol. And of course, cheering up homesick little newcomers like Luca was all part of her role.One day, Luca looked up at Roccia with a sniffle, holding the ticket tightly in her little hand. \"I miss my Mama, Roccia… I want to go home and see her. But I only have a one-way ticket, and I lost it…\"The ticket in his hand read, \"One-Way Ticket to Wonderland,\" written in beautiful handwriting with tiny flowers around the edges.Roccia knew right away what this was about. The Order, always busy banishing anyone who challenged them, would never been so kind to make such a heartwarming ticket. She was sure Luca's mother had made it herself, hoping to give her a bit of comfort. Roccia wanted to reveal the truth to her. \"The Order didn't make these tickets, Luca. From the handwriting, it looks like a kind lady made it… someone who loves you.\" \"They were made by your mother, Luca. They can't really bring you home, so it doesn't matter if they're lost.\"But she knew saying that might only make Luca cry more.Roccia thought for a moment, then left and returned with a new ticket—a \"Return Ticket,\" decorated with painted flowers, seashells, and a hand-drawn stamp that read, \"Arrived at Wonderland.\"Luca's face lit up as she took it, clutching it tightly with a huge smile.As the troupe's prop master, Roccia could easily make something like that, but there was more to it than just crafting. She remembered when Pero had done the same for her when she first arrived on the island. Sometimes, a little piece of paper was all it took to hold a whole lot of hope."

          "Little Roccia lay weak on the Strand, with the wreckage of her pilgrim ship battered to pieces by the waves behind her. Her fading eyes caught glimpses of Tacet Discords scattered across the water. So this would be the end of her \"pilgrimage\"... She closed her eyes, bracing herself for what she thought would be \"divine judgment.\"However, death didn't come as she expected. All she could hear were wind and faint cries in the air. When she opened her eyes, she found herself face-to-face with a peculiar box and a long arm reaching out to her—a hand offering her a second chance at life.At first, Roccia felt lost after joining the troupe, for the little world she once knew had shattered. She soon realized she had been banished simply for singing songs from forbidden plays. The Ragunna she remembered—alive with plays, flowers, and freedom—had faded, leaving only the Order's lies and the hollow shell of her memories. The pilgrimage she once believed in was a ruse, wrapped in false promises, with a so-called \"return ticket\" meant only to fool children like her. Overnight, everything she held dear crumbled. Roccia began to question her love for theater—was it even worth anything anymore? But stranded on a desolate island, she found nothing else to rebuild her world.\"Pero! Pero!\" The odd box handed her a small, hand-drawn ticket with \"Return Trip\" written on it, decorated with painted seashells.\"Pero! Pero!\" It passed her a yellowed play script, filled with tales of Ragunna and lyrics of freedom.\"Pero! Pero!\" Out came a beautifully crafted mask, painted with intricate patterns and adorned with pearls and shells.\"Pero! Pero!\" The box reached out to her once more, inviting her to join the troupe's next performance. Tina's bright voice rang out, Bardolino flew in the air with balloons and tossed petals, Brant swung down on a rope holding a massive welcome banner, and Pero fired the confetti pistol, inviting her to the stage. This lively, chaotic welcome was Roccia's first taste of a different kind of play—a play filled with nothing but pure joy.From that moment on, Roccia began to rebuild her world through the plays held within Pero's box. She saw that Ragunna's grand stage had been a place of strict control, where only songs that conformed to the Order's tenets were permitted. But here, among her fellow \"Fools,\" she could finally express everything—joy, anger, and sorrow—freely. Together, they were all building a new home.Now, Roccia works confidently between the troupe's base and the Strand, calmly coordinating the rescue of new pilgrims and keeping this safe harbor running. Each task, no matter how small, is a piece of the home she's building—a place where she can finally belong, busy and content."

          "People came and went in the Troupe of Fools, each one inspiring Roccia's lively performances. Shows like \"Battier and the Golden Harpoon,\" \"Tina the Soprano Navigator,\" \"Brant the Maverick Captain,\" and \"Pero the Peculiar Box\" became legends of their own. By now, she and the crew had put on over two hundred performances, lighting up every corner of Penitent's End.The troupe didn't have much, so as the prop master, Roccia became a master of turning everyday items into theater magic. Battier's golden harpoon, for instance, had played the part of a Primus's scepter, a wandering knight's sword, and even the La Guardia's dagger. The Echo ship had starred as everything from a lifeboat to a windmill giant's boot and even the eye of a sea monster.For years, Roccia and Pero explored every inch of the Troupe's home base, every stretch of the island shore. They collected countless Luceanites from the Strand and watched thousands of sunrises. Like the others, they had been confined to this place for too long. The troupe was a warm haven for every member, but inevitably, some still dreamed of distant horizons while others longed for the homes they had left behind.When the long-awaited music of the Carnevale drifted across the sea from Ragunna, along with petals celebrating the crowned Laureate, the Troupe of Fools felt the undeniable pull of a homeward wind.Childhood memories were hazy for Roccia, but as she followed Brant and the crew into Ragunna's streets, the familiar smell of Trattoria Margherita's fresh-baked pizza and the songs spilling from the Odyssey Opera House stirred something deep within her, just like it did everyone else.Under a golden sun in a clear sky, the city streets stretched out like a stage waiting for her. A soft breeze seemed to nudge open the box she had always hidden herself in, inviting her to step into a broader world. With open arms and a steady heart, Roccia took her first steps into Ragunna, welcoming a better tomorrow.Now, as the Troupe of Fools' reliable first mate, Roccia stands ready to fill Ragunna's streets with laughter and joy once more."

          "On an ordinary afternoon, the wide streets of Ragunna bustled with people, more lively than in previous years.",
          "The long-anticipated Carnevale was set to return, news that had already spread throughout Ragunna and even across the seas to distant shores. Over the past few days, travelers from all corners had appeared in the city. Even before dinner time, Trattoria Margherita was already packed with eager diners.",
          "Ragunna's fine wines were as captivating as its breathtaking views. Nectarwine had the power to lull someone into a sweet dream, though overindulgence occasionally led to incidents.",
          "What started as a small disagreement over taste soon escalated into a heated debate. Perhaps it was the weariness of restraint, or perhaps the sleepy afternoon simply needed a bit of excitement. Either way, more and more people gathered, joining the argument.",
          "The debate grew fiercer and, in the end, exploded into a full-blown fistfight.",
          "For a moment, the restaurant became a stage. Pizzas and desserts flew through the air, seafood leaped from plates and landed on the faces of passersby, and onlookers scrambled to hide, though many couldn't help but peek back to watch the chaos unfold.",
          "\"Everyone! Oh, don't do that! You'll shatter the plates! Put down your cutlery, it's dangerous, you hear?\" The owner cried out, her tail puffed up as she jumped up and down, waving a pizza paddle. Still, she was too afraid to get too close to the commotion.",
          "Just then, a small figure darted from the crowd.",
          "\"Please, calm down!\"",
          "With a staff in hand, the little figure traced a wide arc through the air. A golden bird descended from the sky, seemingly carrying the weight of the heavens. It barely touched the two enraged men on their foreheads, like a dragonfly skimming the surface of a pond.",
          "The two men, who had been at each other's throats just moments ago, instantly calmed and fell face-first onto the table with smiles, snoring softly.",

          "\"Yes, yes, I saw it with my own eyes! She knocked out those two big guys with just one tap of her staff! Then, out of nowhere, a huge Plushie Echo appeared and carried them off! She looked young, but you can't judge a book by its cover...\"",

Unfortunately, they did not survive. May the Sentinel guide their spirits to peace.",

You and I both know how much we invested in that deal. Now, with nothing left to sustain it, I am left only with the task of trying to fill the void in the best way I can.",

          "Ragunna City was large, yet finding a home here was no easy task. I had lost count of how many doors I had knocked on, and how many times I had been turned away.",
          "After years of working in an orphanage, I had grown accustomed to all sorts of refusals, but I couldn't bear for Phoebe to experience this. She was still so young. What she needed was a warm, stable home, somewhere to heal in peace.",

          "On nights like this, her father used to slip a locket with the Sentinel's portrait under her pillow, telling her that the Divinity would guide her through the storms in her dreams to a safe harbor. Her mother would place a bouquet of daisies by her bedside and tell her bedtime stories. She would say that the Sentinel sends Divine Envoys to protect brave and kind children like her.",

She didn't want to wait for them anymore. This time, she was going to be brave and find them herself.",
          "But the sea wasn't as gentle as her mother described in her stories. She began to hear hurried footsteps on the deck, the noise growing frantic until screams pierced the air as the ship was tossed violently in the storm's grip. The vessel began to sink.",
          "Phoebe cried out for her parents, but the raging waves seemed to whisper that they would never return.",
          "The icy seawater engulfed her, and in her fading vision, she watched her father's locket disappear into the dark depths of the sea.",
          "When she opened her eyes again, she was lying on the shore, soaked to the bone. A Tacet Mark shone on her leg. The Acolytes who found her said no one could survive such a perilous sea, let alone a little girl. They believed it was a blessing from the Sentinel.",
          "But Phoebe faintly remembered that something had saved her. A presence so gentle, like a soft breeze, had lifted her to the surface and laid her gently on the shore, telling her…",
          "Don't be afraid. I'm here.",
          "Something pulled Phoebe from her dream. She felt the bed shift slightly, as though something soft and plush had nestled up beside her. It carried the dampness of the rain and the scent of daisies.",
          "Then Phoebe saw a pair of button eyes and soft, floppy ears—it was the stray Echo she had met in Whisperwind Haven earlier that day. She had untangled the kite string trapping it, naming it Brenno. Later, Brenno introduced Phoebe to many of its friends, took her cloud-watching on the hillsides, wiped away her tears, and even made her a wreath of pretty flowers.",

Sometimes they were thrilling adventures, other times gentle bedtime tales. Her favorite gift had been a pink rabbit stuffed toy. In the story, she was an elegant musician.",

          "The day's work was done, the crowd had dispersed, and everything fell into peaceful quiet. Phoebe sat on a bench, closing her eyes and letting the soft sea breeze wash over her. Time seemed to slow.",
          "Her small figure appeared lonely against the setting sun. Her senior came looking for her, but noticing her shallow breathing realized that she had already fallen asleep.",
          "As the girl slept soundly on the bench, quiet little Echoes crept up from the sides and huddled close to her side.",

As the captain of Rinascita’s Troupe of Fools, he thrives in chaos, reveling in the unpredictable nature of both the stage and life itself. His charisma is effortless; larger than life yet never insincere. He is a free spirit who dances between the whimsical and the profound, unafraid to embrace the absurd yet always carrying a quiet depth beneath his exuberance.",
      "Brant’s romantic nature extends beyond love; he is enamored with the world itself, seeing beauty in every fleeting moment. He believes that life, like a performance, should be embraced fully: boldly, passionately, and without restraint. He slips effortlessly into roles, crafting illusions with his words and presence, yet when the curtain falls, he is remarkably genuine. His loyalty to his troupe and those he cares for is steadfast, and while he may jest and tease, his warmth is undeniable. Though he appears carefree, he is a man who carries his own burdens in silence, choosing to shoulder them with a smile rather than darken the spirits of those around him."

I quickly jotted down in my notes: While I lack the tools to confirm it, I am certain of one thing—Captain Brant is a Natural Resonator. The flames he conjures can light our way, even in the darkest of seas!\n\nInterestingly, I often catch Captain Brant spinning in the air during combat.

          "\"Ha, of course, it is a story!\" He laughed, raising his glass, \"Drink up, my friend, and I'll tell everyone the real tale of the Immortal Returned!\"",
          "The glasses clinked. In an instant, the dreary tavern was transformed into a stage of imagination. Brant swiped the patron's hat and placed it on the bartender's head, his eyes sparkling as he presented the bartender's long-awaited rose to the woman beside him. The bartender, now donning the hat, became the ship's helmsman. The bald patron became a sailor, firing cannons at Tacet Discords from the rolling sea. The woman who received the rose burst into a spontaneous dance. With every spin of the young man's yarn, the patrons found themselves part of his intoxicating tale.",

Battier and Lavito were deep in a heated debate, Hymer and Budd were playing rock-paper-scissors, and Tina was coaching Roccia on breathing techniques for singing. When he said nothing, one of the children mischievously popped a candy into his mouth.",

          "Cheers erupted as if the curtain had been lifted again for an encore.",
          "In the golden light of the rising sun, they saw him—their Captain Brant, riding atop the colossal sea beast's head in triumphant return.",
          "\"Friends, meet our new companion, Lario! We've got ourselves a new ship now!\"",
          "In time, they would build their stage upon the beast's back. Later, they would also discover that Lario was no ordinary Tacet Discord, but a rare Pliosaurus Somnii. Together, they would sail across Rinascita, performing their stories for all to hear.",
          "But for now, Brant stood tall atop the beast, saluting his crew. \"And this, my friend, is a perfect opening! Now, cue the applause!\"",
          "\"BRAVO! BRAVO!\""

          "The all-night revelry had finally come to an end. In Liberty Square, the confetti and streamers still glistened faintly in the early light. Passersby murmured about last night's performance, a fleeting spectacle to them. But for the performers on stage, the falling of the curtain wasn't just an ending, it marked the beginning of something new.",
          "For the first time in ages, they could walk freely through the streets of Ragunna, returning to the homes they had long left behind. When the stage lights dimmed, they cheered for themselves, for in that moment, they reclaimed the simple joy of standing on solid ground once more.",
          "But now that they were on land, what were Fools like them supposed to do? That night, the captain had heartfelt conversations with many in his troupe. Some decided to part ways, returning to families they had missed. With blessings and warm embraces, the captain wished them happiness in their new lives. Others chose to stay with the troupe, eager to seek out new horizons, and the captain welcomed their continued companionship. Then there were those who felt lost, unsure of their next step. For them, the captain offered them a break.",
          "\"After all,\" he said with a playful grin, \"once the Carnevale's over, you need time to clean up the confetti.\"",

          "One morning after the Carnevale, he asked the first mate for a day off. Leaving behind the mask, costume, and even the captain's hat, he set out. First, he bought a pizza from Margherita's, then made a bet with the pigeons in the square. Later, he strolled to the Cathedral of Mercury and pointed at the statue of the Sentinel, saying, \"Hey! Nobody's ever seen you!\"",
          "Finally, he returned to his old home.",
          "\"But I didn't go inside. After being away for so long, the house had already been sold. It's not mine anymore. I thought I'd come to say goodbye, but when I got there, I realized it wasn't needed. But I did hear the sound of a piano.\"",
          "\"It was a piece I didn't recognize. A new family has started their life there, just as I've been walking my own path for years now. I remember how my father used to teach me the piano when I was little, telling me, \"You must find the music you love.\"",
          "\"You can play the piano, Captain?\"",
          "\"Sadly, no. Before I could master it, the Order handed me a ticket for the Pilgrim's Sail. But that's fine. Now, I'm learning the hurdy-gurdy with you all!\"",
          "\"For me, this is home. The songs we sing, the stories we tell. That's the music I've been searching for all along. There's no need to dwell on the past. Because once the confetti's swept up, it's time to prepare for the next revelry!\"",
          "\"So, friends, fancy exploring this big, wide world with me?\"",

Seizing the moment, his father recounted an adventure about unearthing the past and seeking the truth.\nThat Ammonoid became Brant's first treasure and marked the beginning of his journey into a world of endless adventure."

The captain, with a playful wink, called him, \"Captain Brant.\"\nYears later, Brant also remembers his own first performance. Standing high on the mast, he shouted commands to raise the sails and steer the ship clear of deadly whirlpools that threatened to swallow them whole. At that moment, one of the crew reverently placed the very same tricorn upon his head. Cheers erupted as the entire crew shouted in unison, \"Captain Brant! Captain Brant!\""
