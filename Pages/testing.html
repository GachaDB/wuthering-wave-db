            <p>Solidity, practicality, extreme determination and strength of will are characteristics that describe Arend. No one will ever drive him, but he will willingly and loyally follow anyone he trusts. He's a stable, balanced, conservative, law-abiding citizen and loves peace, possessing all the best qualities of the bourgeoisie.</p>
            <p> As he has a sense of material value and physical possessions, respect for property and a horror of falling into debt, he will do everything in his power to maintain the security of the status quo and be somewhat hostile to change.</p>

            <p>Mentally, his characteristics are keen-witted and practical more often than intellectual, but apt to become fixed in his opinions through his preference for following accepted and reliable patterns of experience.</p>
            <p>Arend's character is generally dependable, steadfast, prudent, just, firm and unshaken in the face of difficulties. His vices arise from his virtues, going to extremes on occasion, such as sometimes being too unquestioning to the conventions he admires.</p>

            <p> He's faithful and generous toward friends with a great capacity for affection, but rarely makes friends with anyone outside his social rank, to which he is ordinarily excessively faithful.</p>
            <p>In the main, he's gentle, even tempered, good natured, modest and slow to anger, disliking quarreling and avoiding ill-feeling. If he's provoked, however, he can explode into violent outbursts of ferocious anger in which he seems to lose all self-control. Equally unexpected are his occasional sallies into humor and exhibitions of fun. </p>

          <section>
            <p>Arend was raised and born in Mondstadt. He was the fourth of nine children. Sadly, only four of them are alive today. In his entire life, he's never traveled more than ten miles from Mondstadt. His father, Lukas, is the owner of a restaurant in the city, which he and his brothers are to take over.</p>
            <p>In his youth, Arend was a solid, albeit unspectacular, student. He was brought up in a household that stressed intense religious devotion and personal humility. Arend received a stern education â€“ strict, punitive, and disciplinary â€“ that revolved around devout instruction. Despite being raised in a religious household and still maintaining a belief in The Seven, he has become skeptical of religion as of late.</p>
            <p>Arend had lived a rigorous and predictable life, leading to the oft-repeated story that neighbors would set their clocks by his daily walks. Most of his life had been set for him, but there was a part of him that craved an escape. Joining the Knights of Favonius seemed to open a path on a journey he never expected.</p>

            <p>Arend is decisive and militant and often favors a "take action" approach to solving problems. He will usually approve of individuals who are assertive in their efforts towards restoring order. As a moral and compassionate person, he respects the principles of honor, sacrifice, truth, and selflessness and often approves of others that are kind or who go out of their way to help those in need.</p>

          <section>
            <p>Arend can be somewhat mistrustful of outsiders and will usually approve of a measure of restriction on their freedoms. He is also generally wary of strange magic and spirits and will sometimes look unfavorably toward people who dabble in unknown or forbidden arts. He is not fond of people who keep secrets or not openly honest.</p>

            <p>When it comes to love, Arend is shy and awkward. His inexperience is evident, and his softness makes him easily hurt. He is very traditional when courting, firmly believing in chivalry and romantic gestures. However, he can be remarkably dense and not initiate a thing without explicit confessions.</p>
